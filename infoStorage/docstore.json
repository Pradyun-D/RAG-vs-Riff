Here B abets by\ninstigation the apprehension of C.Explanation 2. - Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the\ncommission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby\nfacilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2977, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0032c545-180d-4352-9436-3a2b49185a9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0032c545-180d-4352-9436-3a2b49185a9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_path": "d:\\LexifyTask2\\InfoDocs\\Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 579257, "creation_date": "2025-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25d43d7c-f4fe-4fdd-9b29-6a71c43d286b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_path": "d:\\LexifyTask2\\InfoDocs\\Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 579257, "creation_date": "2025-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-20"}, "hash": "1b8d79fdfaf64181b3fb33b990b426a250ae65030016225e27b21021f3ab8a08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f385746f-7ba4-497b-aeff-785c173d533c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_path": "d:\\LexifyTask2\\InfoDocs\\Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 579257, "creation_date": "2025-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-20"}, "hash": "71e0a63d51ff54077f844704251a315323f4ea54cc306f6fdd28072a66ae3855", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[Similar to Section 107\nfrom Old IPC-Also Refer ]\nBharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154118812/ 17", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2977, "end_char_idx": 3114, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5973689-c425-4e31-ab85-fd5d287464bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5973689-c425-4e31-ab85-fd5d287464bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_path": "d:\\LexifyTask2\\InfoDocs\\Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 579257, "creation_date": "2025-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cee7501d-b3f7-42cd-b93e-a2022a9e9fa5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_path": "d:\\LexifyTask2\\InfoDocs\\Bharatiya_Nyaya_Sanhita_2023.PDF", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 579257, "creation_date": "2025-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-20"}, "hash": "f0065b44c9beb1d3e4431195e223e5d44176d75bf5212e54441ff9fef2b74dbf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4c269da-add5-491a-b501-347f9d307caa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30e607c3ce9228a920a6a6cd64eac8b6c9726053b23b2ebbf89db88b223f698d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "46.
