It was contended that the actual intention of \\nthe parties was not only to execute the Sale Deed \\nbut also handover the possession which is an \\nimplied term of every sale of immovable property \\nand thus only when on 24.07.1996, the appellant \\nconcerned became capable of handing over \\npossession, limitation would start from such date \\nas otherwise even if the Sale Deed was executed in \\nfavour of the respondents, it would have been of \\nno real consequence in the absence of possession \\nbeing capable of hand over. \\n \\n21.

Having considered the matter, this Court \\nfinds that the Judgment impugned cannot be \\nsustained. The moot question revolves around \\nwhether the Agreement dated 22.11.1990 discloses a \\nfixed time-frame for making payment in full by the \\nrespondents that is, in terms of the recitals in \\nthe agreement for sale executed by the appellant \\nno.1 in favour of the respondents. The admitted \\nposition is that the time indicated in the \\n                                                      \\n1 ‘33. In English law it is not permissible to take into account the subsequen t behaviour or statements of the parties \\nas an aid to interpreting their written agreement – see FL Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1974] AC \\n235. The subsequent behaviour or statements of the parties can, however, be relevant, for a number of other reasons. \\nFirst, they may be invoked to support the contention that the written agreemen t was a sham – ie that it was not in \\nfact intended to govern the parties’ relationship at all. Secondly, they may be invoked in support of a claim for \\nrectification of the written agreement. Thirdly, they may be relied on to support a  claim that the written agreement \\nwas subsequently varied, or rescinded and replaced by a subsequent contr act (agreed by words or conduct). \\nFourthly, they may be relied on to establish that the written agreement represented only part of the totality of the \\nparties’ contractual relationship.’ ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='de9c568f-4bd8-4d5a-82e2-e58d4284815c', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '18', 'file_name': '31.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\31.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775364, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-14'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='18 \\n \\nAgreement was six months from 22.11.1990 i.e., \\ntill 21.05.1991 and as per the Legal Notice dated \\n18.11.1997 sent by the respondents to the \\nappellants, only Rs.7000/- was paid within the \\ntime stipulated.

The respondents were to purchase \\nstamp papers at their expense and the appellants \\nhad to register the Sale Deed either in the name \\nof the respondent no.1 or as proposed by him \\nbefore the Sub-Registrar after paying the \\nremaining/balance amount.

At this juncture, the Court would indicate \\nthat within six months there existed the onus of \\npaying the entire balance amount of Rs.18,000/- by \\nthe respondent no.1 to the appellant no.1.

Pausing here, it is notable that the appellant \\nno.1 having accepted payment of Rs.1,000/- on \\n21.04.1997 i.e., after appellant no.1 had executed \\na Sale Deed in favour of appellant no.7 on \\n05.11.1997, coupled with the fact that the ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='472f222f-4126-4740-b96c-cc7938bf0c4b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '20', 'file_name': '31.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\31.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775364, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-14'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='20 \\n \\nforensic expert found the two thumb -impressions \\npurportedly acknowledging payment after the expiry \\nof the time fixed not matching the fingerprints of \\nappellant no.1 is clearly indicative that time \\nhaving not been extended, no enforceable right \\naccrued to the respondents for getting relief \\nunder the 1963 Act.

For this purpose, we may first \\nturn to the terms of the ag reement. In the \\nagreement of sale, there is no reference to \\nthe existence of any tenant in the \\nbuilding. What it says is that within the \\nperiod of six months, the plaintiff should \\npurchase the stamp papers and pay the \\nbalance consideration whereupon the \\ndefendants will execute the sale deed and \\nthat prior to the registration of the sale \\ndeed, the defendants shall vacate and \\ndeliver possession of the suit house to the \", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='201baf3d-3abc-45c9-a009-e58b3ed0a26b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '27', 'file_name': '31.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\31.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775364, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-14'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text=\"27 \\n \\nplaintiff. There is not a single letter or \\nnotice from the plaintiff to the defendants \\ncalling upon them to get the tenant vacated \\nand get the sale deed executed until he \\nissued the suit notice on 11-7-1981. It is \\nnot the plaintiff's case that within six \\nmonths', he purchased the stamp papers and \\noffered to pay the balance consideration.  \\nThe defendants' case is that the tenant is \\ntheir own relation, that he is ready to \\nvacate at any point of time and that the \\nvery fact that the plaintiff has in his \\nsuit notice offered to purchase the house \\nwith the tenant itself shows that the story \\nput forward by him is false. The tenant has \\nbeen examined by the defendant as DW 2. He \\nstated that soon after the agreement, he \\nwas searching for a house but could not \\nsecure one. Meanwhile (i.e., on the expiry \\nof six months from the date of agreement), \\nhe stated, the defendants told him that \\nsince the plaintiff has abandoned the \\nagreement, he need not vacate. It is \\nequally an admitted fact that between 15-\\n12-1978 and 11-7-1981, the plaintiff has \\npurchased two other properties. The \\ndefendants' consistent refrain has been \\nthat the prices of house properties in \\nMadurai have been rising fast, that within \\nthe said interval of 2 1/2 years, the \\nprices went up three times and that only \\nbecause of the said circumstance has the \\nplaintiff (who had earlier abandoned any \\nidea of going forward with the purchase of \", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='897f23b4-e766-4343-9d9c-b52be74635cc', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '28', 'file_name': '31.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\31.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775364, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-14'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text=\"28 \\n \\nthe suit property) turned round and \\ndemanded specific performance.

The \\nabove finding means that from 15-12-1978 \\ntill 11-7-1981, i.e., for a period of more \\nthan 2 1/2 years, the plaintiff was sitting \\nquiet without taking any steps to perform \\nhis part of the contract under the \\nagreement though the agreement specified a \\nperiod of six months within which he was \\nexpected to purchase stamp papers, tender \\nthe balance amount and call upon the \\ndefendants to execute the sale deed and \\ndeliver possession of the property.  We are \\ninclined to accept the defendants' case \\nthat the values of the house property in \\nMadurai town were rising fast and this must \\nhave induced the plaintiff to wake up after \\n2 1/2 years and demand specific \\nperformance. \\n11.

The claim of the plaintiff in the suit, in a nutshell , is that the property \\naforesaid was acquired and built by the father  of the parties from his self \\nacquired funds but in the name of the defendant no.1 and the family then \\nwas a  Joint Hindu Family.    \\n10. The Benami Act was enacted to prohibit benami transactions and the \\nright to recover property held benami and for matters connected therewith or \\nincidental thereto.  Section 2 (a) thereof defines benami transaction as a \\ntransaction in which property is transferred to one person for a consideration \\npaid or provided by another person. Section 4 thereof bars any suit claim or \\naction to enforce any right in respect of any property held benami against the \\nperson in whose name the property is held and at the instance of a person \\nclaiming to be the real owner of such property. \\n11. In the light of the aforesaid provisions, it was enq uired from the \\ncounsel for the plaintiff whether not the claim of the plaintiff , of the subject \\nproperty being transferred by the DDA to the name of the defendant no.1 for \\nconsideration paid or provided by the father  and of the plaintiff as such \\nbeing the real owner of 1/3rd share in the property by inheritance, against the \\ndefendant no.1 in whose name the property is held, is hit by the bar of the \\nBenami Act and if that were to be the case of the plaintiff whether not, even \\nif there was to be any truth the rein, the said property is liable to acquisition \\nunder Section 5 of the said Act.  \\n12.

The bar imp osed by the Benami Act is invariably found to be  got rid \\nof by pleading a case to be under either of the aforesaid two exceptions. The \\nquestion which arises for consideration  is, whether such a plea has been \\nmade by the plaintiff and even if be so,  whether  a mere plea of the case \\nfalling in exceptions aforesaid is enough for the case to be set down for trial \\nand which, experience of life shows generally drags on for several years , \\nputting a clog on the property and thereby depriving the recorded owner \\nthereof from exercising rights with respect thereto  and often compelling \\nhim/her to settle with the claimants, negating the enactment of Benami Act \\nand allowing litigation before the Courts to be used as a tool of coercion or \\noppression. \\n17. I am of the opini on that though undoubtedly where the pleadings \\nmake out a case for prohibition of the Benami Act to be inapplicable, the \\ncase ought to be set down to trial but not at the mere asking.

The \\nSupreme Court in State of Maharashtra Vs. Narayan Rao (1985) 2 SCC 321 \\nhas held that a joint family may consist of female members also but a Hindu \\ncoparcenary is however a narrower body than the joint family; only male \\nmembers who acquire by birth interest in the joint o r coparcen ary property \\ncan be members of the coparcen ary or coparceners.  The exception contained \\nin 4(3)(a) of the Act restricts its benefit only to property held by a \\n“coparcener in a Hindu Undivided Family” as opposed to any “Member‟ of \\nsuch family.  It  is so because such coparceners are recognized by law to \\njointly by birth inherit rights in the joint property of the family and in the \\nevent such property stands in one of their names for the benefit of others, the \\nBenami Act is de clared to not come in th e way.

Though it is pleaded that the family at the time of acquisition of the \\nplot was a joint Hindu family but it is nowhere pleaded that the plot  was \\nacquired or construction raised thereon from the funds of the family.

Mulla‟s commentary on Hindu Law, 18th Edition under para 214 \\nthereof explains the genesis of coparcenery as under:- \\nA coparcenary is created in the following manner: A Hindu male \\nA, who has inherited no property at all from his father, \\ngrandfather, or great -grandfather, acquires property by his own \\nexertions. A has a son B, B does not take any vested interest in \\nthe self -acquired property of A during A’s lifetime, but on A’s \\ndeath, he inherits the self -acquired property of A.  If B has a son \\nC, C takes a vested interest in the property by reason of his birth, \\nand the property inherited by B from his father A becomes \\nancestral property in his (B’s) hands, and B and C are \\ncoparceners as regards the property.  If B and C continue joint, \\nand a son D is born to C, he enters the coparcenary by th e mere \\nfact of his birth.  Moreover, if a son E is subsequently born to D, \\nhe too becomes a coparcener. \\n22. The Supreme Court in Makhan Singh Vs.

Merely because a person at the time of acquisition of the property may \\nbe residing with his parents and siblings and merely because the sale \\nconsideration has flown from the pa rents or from some other siblings is not \\nenough to bring a case within the exception aforesaid to the  prohibition \\ncontained in Benami Act. It cannot be lost sight of that benami transactions \\nprevalent earlier, generally were between family members and hard ly ever in \\nthe name of absolute strangers , and if pleas as in the present case were to be \\nheld to be falling within the exception clause, would negate the legislative \\nintent of prohibiting actions to enforce rights in respect of property held \\nbenami. \\n26. I have considered whether the long admitted possession at least from \\nthe year 19 67 till 2006 -2007 i.e. of ne arly 40 years of plaintiff of the \\npremises can be said to raise any presumption of jointness or of the intent \\nbut I am unable to hold so. Such posses sion has to be seen in the context of \\nIndian conditions where  siblings especially brothers living together, even \\nafter their marriages, in a house belonging to one of them, is not uncommon.

As far exception (b) supra is concerned, it was imperative fo r the \\nplaintiff to plead a relationship of trust between the defendant no.1 and \\nearlier the father and/or that of defendant no.1 was standing in a fiduciary \\ncapacity and holding the property for the benefit of the father. There are no \\nsuch pleas in the pla int.  The plaintiff has merely relied on Sri Marcel \\nMartins. The Supreme Court in the said judgment has held that in \\ndetermining whether a relationship is based on trust or confidence , relevant \\nto determining whether they stand in a fiduciary capacity, the  Court shall \\nhave to take into consideration the factual context in which the question \\narises for it is only in the factual backdrop that the existence or otherwise of \\na fiduciary relationship can be deduced in a given case.    \\n28. Having said that , it bec omes important to see the factual context in \\nwhich the said observations were made. In that case it was not in dispute that \\nthe title to the property even though as a tenant originally vested in the \\ncommon ancestor of the parties who had died intestate and  was transferred \\nin the name of one of the heirs only at the instance of the Municipal \\nCorporation to avoid procedural complications and all the legal heirs had \\nmade contributions towards the sale consideration for conversion of the \\ntenancy rights into own ership rights and it was in these facts that the \\nSupreme Court held the plea of benami to be not available and held the case \\nto be falling in the exception. The present is however not a case of parties \\nacquiring title to the property from a common ancestor ; rather the case is \\nthat the common ancestor from his self acquired funds had acquired the \\nsubject property in the name of the defendant no.1.

I would be failing in my duty if do not refer to the Division Bench \\ndicta in Manjeet Singh Anand Vs. Sarabit Singh Anand \\nMANU/DE/1205/2009 where rejection of the plaint on the ground of claim \\ntherein being barred by the Benami Act was denied on the existence in the \\nplaint of the plea of existence of a joint family and which was held to imply \\nHindu Undivided Family , observing that though the case of the plaintiff \\ntherein was weak and not likely to succeed but holding the same to be no \\nground for ousting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. However \\nin that case there were averments in the plaint of the property being held for \\nthe benefit of coparcerners in the family and the defendant holding the \\nproperty as a trustee for the benefit of all the family members and which as \\naforesaid are lacking in the present case. I therefore do not consider myself \\nbound by the said judgment. Mention in this regard may also be made of \\nanother Division Bench of this Court in Babita Pal Vs. Jagdish Bansal 196 \\n(2013) DLT 792 where also a plea for summary dismissal of the suit for \\nreason of the claim therein being barred by the Benami Act was rejected for \\nthe reason that the real import of the transaction and the relation between the \\nparties could be determined on ly after trial.

That brings me to the only document in this regard filed by the \\ndefendant no.1 and qua which application aforesaid has also been filed by \\nthe plaintiff for examination of the signatures by this Court and/or f or \\nreference of the signatures to a n expert. The counsel for the plaintiff in this \\nregard has also relied on paras 36 to 39 of Ajit Savant Majagavi Vs. State of \\nKarnataka AIR 1997 SC 3255.  \\n31.  In the said affidavit purportedly of the defendant no.1 , the defendant \\nno.1 has deposed that he is a member of the Joint Hindu Family headed by \\nthe father; that the father had purchased the plot and constructed on the same \\nin his name; that the expenses incurred on the house were being borne  by \\nand income therefrom being also received by the father as head of the joint \\nfamily.  \\n32. The question which arises is whether the said affidavit would take the \\nsuit away from the clutches / prohibition of the Benami Act.  \\n33. I am unable to see how. If the same were to be perm itted, it would \\namount to the Courts permitting the Benami Act to be defeated merely by  \\nthe real owners  obtaining execution of such documents from the benami \\nowners; rather the said affidavit is a n unequivocal admission of the property \\nbeing benami and rig hts wherein cannot be enforced by the plaintiff \\nclaiming to be the true owner of a share in the property by inheritance from \\nthe father.

Even otherwise, without any special circumstances  and which are not \\npleaded, there cannot be any question of a grown up son being a trustee of \\nthe father or standing in a fiduciary capacity qua the father.  \\n35. Thus whichever way one looks at, the claim in the suit is barred by the \\nBenami Act.  \\n36. Faced therewith the counsel for the plaintiff had contended that the \\nplaintiff has been in possession of the first floor and even if not having any \\nrights in the prope rty, cannot be dispossessed therefrom without due process \\nof law.  \\n37. However the report as aforesaid of the commission issued at the \\ninstance of the plaintiff is of the first floor though containing the belongings \\nof the plaintiff being not in use for th e last several years. The Commissioner , \\nas directed, has also taken photographs and a perusal whereof also supports \\nthe said report. In any case no objections against the said report have been \\nfiled. Moreover, once it is held that the plaintiff has no righ t in the property \\nand was living therein as a licencee of the defendant no.1 and once it is \\nfound that the plaintiff on the date of institution of the suit was not living in \\nthe property, mere finding of the goods and articles  belonging to the plaintiff \\nin the said premises would not entitle the plaintiff to be put back into \\npossession. Reference in this regard may be made to Section 65 of the Indian \\nEasement Act, 1882 which provides the remedy of dispossessed licensee as \\nfor compensation only and not for r epossession.

In  any  event,  the  terms  “honourable  acquittal”  or \\n“fully exonerated” are unknown in the Code of Criminal \\nProcedure  or  in  Criminal  Jurisprudence. These  terms\\ncame up for consideration before a Division Bench of the \\nMadras High Court in the case of Union of India Vs.\\nJayaram,  AIR  1960  Madras  325.  Rajammannar,  C.J. \\nDelivering the judgment of the Division Bench observed \\nas under:- \\nThere  is  no  conception  like  “honourable \\nacquittal” in Criminal Procedure Code The \\nonus of establishing the guilt of accused is \\non the prosecution, and if it fails to establish \\nthe  guilt  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the \\naccused is entitled to be acquitted. \\nClause (b) of Article 193 of the Civil Service \\nRegulations  which  says  that  when  a \\nGovernment  servant  who  was  under \\nsuspension is honourably acquitted, he may \\nbe given the full salary to which he would \\nhave  been  entitled  if  he  had  not  been \\nsuspended  applies  only  to  the  case  of \\ndepartmental Inquiry. \\nWhere the servant was suspended because \\nthere  was  a  criminal  prosecution  against \\nhim,  and  he  was  acquitted  therein,  and \\nreinstated he is entitled under the general \\nlaw, to the full pay during the period of his \\nsuspension.

Considering  the  impact  of\\nRules 7.3,7.5 and 7.6 of the Punjab Civil Services Rules \\nVol.I Part-I, it was observed as follows:- \\n(2) XXX XXX XXX \\nThe interpretation which has been put \\nby the Government on the rule is incorrect. \\nThe blame which attached to the petitioner \\nwas that there was a criminal charge against \\nhim under which he was standing his trial. \\nThe moment he is acquitted of the charge, he \\nis acquitted of the blame. In criminal law, \\nthe Courts are called upon to decide whether \\nthe  prosecution  has  succeeded  in  bringing \\nhome the guilt to the accused. The moment \\nthe Court is not satisfied regarding the guilt \\nof the accused, he is acquitted. Whether a \\nperson  is  acquitted  after  being  given  a \\nbenefit  of  doubt  or  for  that  reasons,  the \\nresult  is  that  his  guilt  is  not  proved.  The \\nCode  of  Criminal  Procedure  does  not \\ncontemplate honourable acquittal. The \\nonly  words  known  to  the  Code  are \\n'discharged'  or  'acquitted'.  The  effect  of  a \\nperson being discharged or acquitted is the \\nsame in the eyes of law. Since, according to \\nthe accepted notions of imparting criminal \\njustice,  the  Court  has  to  be  satisfied \\nregarding the guilt of the accused beyond a \\nreasonable  doubt,  it  is  generally  held  that \\nthere being a doubt in the mind of the court, \\nthe accused is acquitted. \\nI am, therefore, quite clear in my mind \\nthat the intention underlying Rule 7.5 can be \\nno  other  except  this”  the  moment  the \\ncriminal  charge  on  account  of  which  an \\nofficer was suspended fails in a court of law, \\nhe should be deemed to be acquitted of the \\nblame.  Any  other  interpretation  would \\ndefeat  the  very  purpose  of  the  rule.

Whether the alleged assailant’s application ismaintainable or not? Such a question has come for consideration before this Court in the present appeal.\\nFacts of the case:\\n2.1. The present appeals have been filed by the complainant-wife, against the orders dated 07.07.2022 passed by thelearned Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge Bengaluru City in Criminal Misc. No. 3941/2022, 3943/2022,3944/2022 and 3945/2022. By the said orders, the learned Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge Bengaluru City hasgranted anticipatory bail to the accused-husband and his family namely, accused Nos. 2,3 & 4 in FIR No. 43/2022which alleged commission of offences under Sections 498A, 406 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (‘IPC’, forshort), registered by the complainant-wife at Chirawa Police Station, District Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan.\\n2.2. In view of the above, we take note of the social reality of criminal complaints relating to dowry harassment, cruelty anddomestic violence arising out of unsuccessful matrimonial relationships. With the increasing migration of young people formarital and career prospects, supplemented by the forces of economic liberalization, a significant number of couples hailfrom two different States, with the corollary \\x0c being that the matrimonial home of a complainant-wife is located in adifferent State from where her parental home is located.\\n3. According to the complainant-wife (appellant herein), the facts giving rise to the present appeal, in a nutshell as gatheredfrom the material on record are:\\n3.1. The complainant-wife got married to the accused-husband on 11.12.2020 and started living in Bengaluru. 3.2. On09.11.2021, the accused-husband filed a divorce petition M.C. No. 5786/2021 under Section 13 of the Hindu MarriageAct, 1955 before the Principal Judge, Family Court, Bengaluru, Karnataka. Notice was issued in the divorce petitionon 15.11.2021. 3.3. On 07.03.2022, the complainant-wife filed Transfer Petition No.590/22 before this Court totransfer the case from the Principal Judge, Family Court, Bengaluru to Court of Additional District Judge, Chirawa,Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan.\\n3.4. The complainant-wife registered a First Information Report (‘FIR’, for short) being FIR No. 43/2022 for offencesunder Sections 498A, 406 and 323 of the IPC, at Chirawa Police Station, District Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, on25.01.2022 at 06.07 pm. \\x0c 3.5. At the time of marriage, two younger siblings of the complainant-\\nwife were still unmarried. The father of the complainant-wife, despite being a heart patient who had undergone Angioplasty,spent about Rs. 46,00,000/- on the wedding and had met the dowry demands made by the accused-husband and his familymembers being his father, mother and younger brother, i.e., accused Nos.2, 3 & 4.\\n3.6. That the complainant-wife was a victim of harassment, torture and assault for the demand of dowry. The accused-husband and his family claimed that they had been cheated because the complainant-wife’s father had promised to spend onecrore rupees for the marriage. The harassment and torture continued from 11.12.2020 until 06.07.2021. For less than a yearof marriage that the couple spent together, the accused-husband perpetrated cruelty upon her by frequently threatening todivorce her and get married for the second time. 3.7. The accused-husband started threatening and abusing the complainant-wife and stated that the complainant-wife was mentally and physically incapable of intimate relationships. Additionally, heslapped the complainant-wife about a month after the marriage and said that he was not inclined for marriage and preferredto live a free life. He threatened the complainant-wife that if she wanted to stay together, she would have to fulfil the dowrydemand.\\n\\x0c 3.8. The complainant-wife informed her in-laws, being accused Nos. 2, 3 and 4, about the refusal of the accused-husbandto consummate the marriage and the physical assault committed on her. Allegedly, her in- laws dismissed her by saying that itwas not necessary to have a relationship with the husband and as such, being a husband, he had the right to beat her.\\n3.9. Deeply agonized by this experience, a demand regarding purchase of a scooter for the accused-husband was met.Rs.1,01,326/- was to be paid online from complainant-wife’s mother's bank account on 12.02.2021.\\n3.10. Thereafter, the accused-husband started demanding a car, but the demand could not be fulfilled. The complainant-wifewas harassed even when she was COVID-19 positive, and eventually, she was driven out of the matrimonial house on02.06.2021. The complainant-wife’s father begged the accused-husband to take back his daughter, but the accused-husbandrefused.\\n3.11. Thereafter, on 11.06.2021, the complainant-wife’s father was forced to bring the complainant-wife back to Chirawa.3.12. It was averred that goods and valuables worth Rs. 30,00,000/- were still in possession of the accused-husband and hisfamily.

The complainant-wife refused to undergo a medical test and noted that at the time she was thrown out of the accused-husband’s house, she had shown light blue marks near the neck and shoulder to her parents but being hopeful of a change inthe attitude of the husband, and affected by social stigma, she did not file any report. 3.14. The Sub-Inspector, ChirawaPolice Station, Rajasthan made a note that from the victim’s report, the offences under Sections 498A, 406 and 323 of theIPC were made out and the investigation was initiated.\\nWe reiterate that the aforesaid details are as narrated by the complainant and are not our inferences of facts of the case.Impugned Orders:\\nThe accused-husband and his family members, accused Nos. 2, 3 and 4, sought the relief of anticipatory bail underSection 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’, for short) by filing CRL.

The learned Judge further reasoned that since the alleged offences were not punishable with death orimprisonment for life and are to be tried before the Magistrate, there was absolutely no reason to deny the benefit ofanticipatory bail.\\n4.3. When the police of Chirawa called upon the accused-husband and his family members, accused Nos. 2, 3 & 4, it wasrealised that the learned Sessions Judge, Bengaluru, had granted them anticipatory bail. \\x0c This was confirmed by thecomplainant-wife when she checked the Court’s website.\\n4.4. On 09.12.2022, this Court allowed complainant-wife’s Transfer Petition No.590/22 and transferred the M.C. No.5786/2021 from the Principal Judge, Family Court, Bengaluru, to the Court of Additional District Judge, Chirawa,Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan.\\n5. Being aggrieved by the grant of anticipatory bail to the accused- husband and accused Nos. 2, 3 and 4, the complainant-wife filed W.P. No.48/2023 before this Court, which came to be dismissed as withdrawn on 17.02.2023 with liberty topursue her legal remedies.\\n6. Thereafter, the present Special Leave to Appeal came to be filed and notice was issued by this Court on 17.03.2023. On07.07.2023, this Court requested learned Additional Solicitor General Sri Vikramjit Banerjee to assist the Court as an amicuscuriae, having regard to the ramifications that would arise in the context of Section 438 of CrPC and the jurisdiction of theconcerned Sessions Court or High Court to grant pre-arrest bail, when the FIR is not registered within the territorialjurisdiction of a particular district or State but in a different State. \\x0c Submissions:\\n7. We have heard Sri Vikramjeet Banerjee, Additional Solicitor General and learned amicus, Sri Kaustav Paul, learned seniorcounsel for the complainant-wife, Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned Additional Advocate General for the State of Rajasthan, SriV.N. Raghupathy, learned counsel for the State of Karnataka and Smt. Anjana Sharma, learned counsel for the accused-husband. We have also perused the material on record.\\n7.1. Learned senior counsel Sri Banerjee, while assisting this Court as an amicus, submitted as under:\\ni. Section 438 of CrPC has only used the term ‘High Court or the Court of Session’, as the case may be’ but has notspecified whether such a ‘High Court or the Court of Session’ has to be the same Court which can take cognizance ofthe matter or can be any ‘High Court or Court of Session’ across the country. Therefore, there exists limited legislativeguidance about the power of a Court to grant anticipatory bail for an offence that is registered outside its territorialjurisdiction, in other words, whether ‘extra-territorial anticipatory bail’ can be granted by a High Court or Court ofSession to a person apprehending arrest.\\nii. Elaborating on the divergent approaches of various High Courts in the country regarding the grant of ‘extra-territorial anticipatory bail’, learned amicus submitted that the Courts have evolved the \\x0c  ‘transit anticipatory bail’approach to provide an equitable and interim relief enabling an accused travelling a residing in a different State to seek', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='6f5cbf53-4144-4c87-913e-97f432a43763', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='anticipatory bail. Learned amicus clarified that anticipatory bail and ‘transit anticipatory bail’ are different, as theformer may or may not be restricted to a time period, whereas the latter is always granted for a specific time period,until an applicant can make an application for anticipatory bail before a Court that can take ‘cognizance’ of theoffence. It was further submitted that this Court had adopted the ‘transit anticipatory bail’ approach in State of Assamvs. Brojen Gogol (Dr), (1998) 1 SCC 397 (Brojen Gogol) and Amar Nath Neogi vs. State of Jharkhand, (2018) 11SCC 797.\\niii. Learned amicus further submitted that this Court in Nathu Singh vs. State of U.P., (2021) 6 SCC 64 (Nathu Singh) hademphasized a liberal approach to the grant of anticipatory bail in view of the serious impact that the unfair denial of the samecan have on the right to life and liberty under Article 21.\\niv. Referring to the judgement of this Court in Navinchandra Majithia vs. State of Maharashtra, (2000) 7 SCC 640, learnedamicus apprised this Court of an alternative approach that is based on the ‘cause of action’ theory in criminal law. In view ofthe facts of the present case, it was submitted that the cause of action essentially arose in the matrimonial home of the partiesin \\x0c  Bengaluru, Karnataka and continued in the complainant-wife’s paternal home in Chirawa, Rajasthan. Therefore, Courtsat either of these places may exercise their jurisdiction. 7.2. Learned senior counsel Sri Paul appearing for the complainant-wife/appellant herein submitted as follows:\\ni. The right to fair and impartial investigation and trial of an offence is a fundamental right not only of the accused butalso of the complainant.\\nii. Grant of bail by the Court at Bengaluru in an F.I.R which was not lodged within its territorial Jurisdiction, had leftthe complainant- wife without an opportunity to oppose the same. iii. The complainant-wife could not oppose the bailpetition and the jurisdictional prosecutor from Chirawa, Rajasthan was also absent during the hearing. That only thePublic Prosecutor of Bengaluru was present at the time of the hearing of the bail petition seeking anticipatory bail. Thesaid prosecutor neither had the case diary of the investigation with him nor any assistance from the area police stationwhere the F.I.R had been lodged. Hence, the impugned orders may be set aside.\\n7.3. Learned senior counsel for the State of Rajasthan Dr. Manish Singhvi submitted as under:\\ni. The existence of territorial jurisdiction is the undergrid of the institution of any case before a Court of law. Theconcept of territorial jurisdiction is of cardinal significance to the administration of justice. More specifically, bothChapter XIII of the CrPC and the existing/general criminal jurisprudence recognize that cognizance of an offence andnot the offender is taken. That this Court in Raghubans Dubey vs. State of Bihar (1967) 2 SCR 423 (RaghubansDubey) held that the Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence and not the offender. That territorial jurisdictionassumes paramount importance as the offender, unlike the defendant in a civil suit instituted as per the Civil ProcedureCode, 1908, has no role to play as far as the conferment of jurisdiction of a Court is concerned. That, in DashrathRupsingh Rathod vs. State of Maharashtra, (2014) 9 SCC 129, it was observed that Section 177 of the CrPCpostulated that every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a Court within whose local jurisdiction it wascommitted.\\nii. Elaborating on the scheme of the CrPC, Dr. Singhvi submitted that Chapter II of the CrPC distributes adjudicatory dutiesamongst Magistrates and Courts as per territorial jurisdiction. Section 14 of the CrPC specifically determines the jurisdictionof local Magistrate(s). The provisions granting power to take cognizance (Section 157) or power to investigate (Section 156),are in \\x0c  accordance with the concept of ‘ordinary place of inquiry and trial,’ as stated in Chapter XIII of the CrPC.\\niii. Therefore, the Court under whose territorial jurisdiction the offence was committed becomes the Court of competentjurisdiction to pass all orders, including bail and anticipatory bail. That the language of Section 167(2) mandating a judicialorder for the detention of an accused beyond 24 hours, mentions ‘nearest Magistrate’ and not Magistrate of competentjurisdiction. The nearest Magistrate, while possessing the power to extend custody up to 15 days, does not have the power togrant bail as the same power is reserved only for the Magistrate who is competent to commit the case for trial. In this regard,learned senior counsel submitted that the power of ‘the High Court or the Court of Session’ to grant pre-arrest anticipatorybail under Section 438 of CrPC cannot be invoked by a Court which does not have territorial jurisdiction. It was furthercontended that a proper construction of the word ‘the’ prefixed to both High Court and Sessions Court in the text of Section438 of CrPC would mean the High Court or the Sessions Court having the competent jurisdiction. It was contended that theword ‘the’ cannot be given so liberal a construction that it becomes indistinguishable from ‘any.’ iv. Learned senior counselapprised this Court that even after the introduction of the provision of anticipatory bail in the CrPC in 1973, many States,such as Uttar Pradesh, did not have the said \\x0c provision for decades altogether. It was further pointed out that practicaldifficulties such as forum shopping may arise from the treatment of anticipatory bail as analogous to a fundamental right.The difficulty would arise if a High Court would grant pre-arrest bail for an offence committed in a State where the provisionfor anticipatory bail does not exist. This may lead to a situation where the High Court or the Court of Session would nothave the advantage of the stance of the investigating agency or the assistance of the public prosecutor while adjudicating', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='9ed44ad4-b19e-43c7-a453-840dab7e17e1', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='applications for grant of anticipatory bail. In view thereof, it was submitted that the High Court judgements, In Re: BenodRanjan Sinha, 1981 SCC Online Cal 102 (In Re: Benod Ranjan Sinha), L.R. Naidu (Dr.) vs. State of Karnataka, 1983 SCCOnLine Kar 206 (L.R. Naidu) and N.K. Nayar vs. State of Maharashtra, 1985 Cri LJ 1887 (N.K. Nayar), permitting thegrant of anticipatory bail for an offence committed outside their jurisdiction, should be set aside. To buttress his contention,learned senior counsel submitted that the Justice V.S. Malimath Committee Report on Reforms in Criminal Justice System, insection 7.33, page 121, had proposed that the provision regarding anticipatory bail may be retained subject to two conditions:that the Court would hear the Public Prosecutor; and that the petition for anticipatory bail should be heard only by the Courtof competent jurisdiction.\\nv. As an alternative form of relief to persons resident in a particular State but apprehending arrest by the police in anotherState, learned senior counsel relied upon judgements of this Court in Balchand Jain vs. State of M.P., (1976) 4 SCC 572(Balchand Jain) and Sushila Aggarwal vs. NCT of Delhi, (2020) 5 SCC 1 (Sushila Aggarwal), which enunciated the approachof ‘transit anticipatory bail’ and ‘interim protection’ that balanced the right to life and personal liberty enshrined in Article 21and the right to freedom of movement under Article 19(1)(d) with the fundamental scheme of administration of criminaljustice, as prescribed in the CrPC. It was submitted that in an age where the movement of a citizen is frequent and fast, anoffender may apprehend arrest even with respect to a statement made in a place of residence in one State, but the offendedperson may be residing in another State. vi. Learned senior counsel further contended that in order to prevent the abuse ofthe process of law, this Court may hold that interim protection for a limited period could be granted by the Court nearest tothe residence of the accused apprehending arrest. However, in order to prevent forum shopping, certain safeguards were alsosuggested for availing grant of interim protection as follows:\\na. The person must show some residence proof to establish that he/she had been residing in the area in which theinterim protection is sought;\\n\\x0c  b. If the person is seeking interim protection apart from his/her normal place of residence, he/she must state thereasons for doing so and also disclose the nature of apprehension of arrest in the area wherein he/she does not reside;\\nc. The interim protection should not exceed a period of fourteen days under normal circumstances;\\nd. The concerned public prosecutor of the Court wherein interim application is moved may be informed in advanceabout the filing of the interim protection application. The public prosecutor after looking at the nature of the interimprotection application, may contact the concerned police station and seek information about the stage and nature of theinvestigation of the crime committed;\\ne. The limited duration of the interim protection to secure the liberty of the individual from arrest in an allegedfrivolous case would also ensure that the regular anticipatory bail is only granted by a Court of competent jurisdiction;and f. Interim protection should not be granted unless the requirements enumerated under Section 438 of CrPC aresatisfied.\\n7.4. Learned counsel for the State of Karnataka submitted that having regard to the relevant judicial precedents onSection 438 of CrPC, an appropriate order may be made in this case.\\n\\x0c 7.5. Smt. Anjana Sharma, learned counsel for the accused-husband submitted as under:\\ni. The complainant-wife had filed a frivolous FIR against him and his family members based on false allegations andaccusations. It is alleged that the sole objective of complainant-wife is to extort money as the accused-husband hadrefused to pay an amount of Rs. 50,00,000/-.\\nii. That the anticipatory bail applications had been filed for securing protection from immediate arrest as the liberty ofthe petitioner was at stake and instant protection was necessary to protect his fundamental rights.\\niii. That the apprehension of arrest was during the subsistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and he was undercontinuous pressure and threat of being arrested. The accused-husband being the only earning member having ayounger brother and an elderly ailing father, was compelled to seek protection of his life and limb because thecomplainant-wife’s father had influential local contacts in the place where the FIR was registered, i.e., Chirawa,Rajasthan. There was a reasonable apprehension of his arrest, which was the guiding factor in filing the applicationbefore the Bengaluru Court. iv. Learned counsel of the accused-husband also questioned the bona fides of thecomplainant-wife by relying upon the delay in filing the present petition. It was further contended that the FIR wasfiled in \\x0c  Chirawa Police Station with the sole objective of causing harassment to accused-husband and his family as', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='73d584d1-5106-4483-8808-7e2d3c24e1a7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='the alleged offences were committed in Bengaluru. That the complainant-wife is familiar with Bengaluru as evenearlier, she was working with a Mumbai-based company in Bengaluru.\\nPoints for Consideration:\\n8. Having heard learned amicus and senior counsel and counsel for the respective parties and on perusal of the material onrecord, the following points would emerge for our consideration:\\ni. Whether the power of the High Court or the Court of Session to grant anticipatory bail under Section 438 of theCrPC could be exercised with respect to an FIR registered outside the territorial jurisdiction of the said Court?\\nii. Whether the practice of granting transit anticipatory bail or interim protection to enable an applicant seekinganticipatory bail to make an application under Section 438 of the CrPC before a Court of competent jurisdiction isconsistent with the administration of criminal justice?\\niii. What order?\\nThe aforesaid questions shall be considered together as they are intertwined.\\n\\x0c Legal Framework:\\n9. Before discussing the points for consideration in the present appeal, the relevant provisions of the CrPC are exposited asunder:\\n9.1. Section 2(e) of the CrPC defines \"High Court\" to mean ‘the High Court for that State,’ in relation to any State. Inrelation to the Union Territory, it is defined as that High Court for a State to which the Union Territory’s jurisdictionhas been extended. In case of any other Union territory, it means the highest Court of criminal appeal for that territoryother than the Supreme Court of India.\\n9.2. Section 2(j) defines \"local jurisdiction\", in relation to a Court or Magistrate to mean the local area within which theCourt or Magistrate may exercise its powers under the CrPC. Section 14 of the CrPC states that the local jurisdictionof a magistrate shall be confined to the limits defined by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. Section 9 of the CrPC mandatesthat the State Government shall establish a Court of Session to be presided over by a judge appointed by the HighCourt. 9.3. A Court of competent jurisdiction is referred to in Section 41A of the CrPC wherein a police officer isempowered to arrest a person who fails to comply with a notice for arrest subject to the orders of such Court. This isa Court that is competent to try the case. Section 167(2) empowers the nearest Magistrate to authorize the custody ofan accused for a period not exceeding 15 days, once he is produced before him, \\x0c whether it is a Court of competentjurisdiction to try the case or not. If the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial, andconsiders further detention unnecessary, he may order the accused to be forwarded to a Magistrate having suchjurisdiction. Section 156 further postulates that any officer in-charge of a police station may investigate any cognizablecase which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have power to inquireinto or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII. 9.4. Section 177 in Chapter XIII of the CrPC mandates that everyoffence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a Court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed. In caseof uncertainty or ambiguity regarding the local areas where an offence is committed, Section 178 postulates that it maybe inquired into or tried by a Court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas where the offence, or part thereof,may have been committed. Section 179 states that when the consequence of the offending act ensues, it may beinquired into or tried by a Court within whose local jurisdiction such thing has been done or such consequence hasensued.\\n9.5. Having regard of the aforesaid statutory framework, it would be apposite to distillate the core aspects of Section438 of CrPC pertaining to grant of anticipatory bail which reads as under:\\n“438. Direction for grant of bail to person apprehending arrest.-\\n\\x0c (1) Where any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section that in the', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='f12de90a-6871-482a-ba05-8aa949f41907', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='event of such arrest he shall be released on bail; and that Court may, after taking into consideration, inter-alia, thefollowing factors, namely:—\\n(i) the nature and gravity of the accusation;\\n(ii) the antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether he has previously undergone imprisonment onconviction by a Court in respect of any cognizable offence;\\n(iii) the possibility of the applicant to flee from justice; and\\n(iv) where the accusation has been made with the object of injuring or humiliating the applicant by having him soarrested, either reject the application forthwith or issue an interim order for the grant of anticipatory bail;\\nProvided that, where the High Court or, as the case may be, the Court of Session, has not passed any interim order underthis sub-section or has rejected the application for grant of anticipatory bail, it shall be open to an officer in-charge of a policestation to arrest, without warrant the applicant on the basis of the accusation apprehended in such application. (1A) Wherethe Court grants an interim order under sub-section (1), it shall forthwith cause a notice being not less than seven daysnotice, together with a copy of such order to be served on the Public Prosecutor and the Superintendent of Police, with aview to give the Public Prosecutor a reasonable opportunity of being heard when the application shall be finally heard by theCourt.\\n(1B) The presence of the applicant seeking anticipatory bail shall be obligatory at the time of final hearing of the applicationand passing of final order by the Court, if on an application made to it by the Public Prosecutor, the Court considers suchpresence necessary in the interest of justice.\\n\\x0c  (2) When the High Court or the Court of Session makes a direction under sub-section (1), it may include such conditionsin such directions in the light of the facts of the particular case, as it may thinks fit, including—\\n(i) a condition that the person shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required;\\n(ii) a condition that the person shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any personacquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer;\\n(iii) a condition that the person shall not leave India without the previous permission of the Court;\\n(iv) such other condition as may be imposed under sub-section (3) of section 437, as if the bail were granted under thatsection.\\n(3) If such person is thereafter arrested without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station on such accusation, and isprepared either at the time of arrest or at any time while in the custody of such officer to give bail, he shall be released onbail, and if a Magistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that a warrant should issue in the first instance against thatperson, he shall issue a bailable warrant in conformity with the direction of the Court under Sub-Section (1).\\n(4) Nothing in this section shall apply to any case involving the arrest of any person on accusation of having committed anoffence under sub-section (3) of section 376 or section 376AB or section 376DA or section 376DB of the Indian Penal Code(45 of 1860).” 9.6 The salient features of Section 438 of CrPC can be culled out as under:\\n\\x0c i. It confers a statutory right upon any person who has a reason to believe that he may be arrested in relation to thecommission of a non-bailable offence.\\nii. The statutory right consists of the right to apply before the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction that inthe event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail.\\niii. The Parliament has provided ample legislative guidance on the factors that may guide the High Court or the Courtof Session while considering the application for grant of an anticipatory bail. iv. The substantive factors consist of thenature and gravity of the accusation, the criminal antecedents of the applicant, the risk of the applicant abscondingfrom justice or not cooperating with the criminal justice administration and the possibility of an accusation made in badfaith with the aim of injuring or humiliating the applicant.\\nv. In addition to the aforementioned substantive factors guiding the exercise of judicial discretion, Section 438 of CrPCengrafts certain procedural requirements. The High Court or the Court of Session may grant an interim order underSection 438(1) of CrPC in case the facts and averments in the application satisfy the factors laid down.

The Court is also empowered under Section 438 (1B) of CrPC to allow thePublic Prosecutor’s application to make the presence of the applicant seeking anticipatory bail obligatory at the time offinal hearing, if the Court deems such presence necessary in the interest of justice. vi. The High Court or the Court ofSession, under Section 438(2) of CrPC, is further empowered to pass any such conditions in light of the facts of aparticular case, including\\na) A condition that the person shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required;\\nb) a condition that the person shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any personacquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any policeofficer;\\nc) a condition that the person shall not leave India without the previous permission of the Court;\\n\\x0c  d) such other condition as may be imposed under Sub-Section (3) of section 437, as if the bail is being grantedunder that Section.\\nvii.

If a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence decides that a warrant should be issued inthe first instance against that person, he is empowered to issue a bailable warrant in conformity with the direction of theCourt under Section 438(1). viii. The Parliament has inserted clause (4) to Section 438 of CrPC vide the Criminal Law(Amendment) Act, 2018, thereby stipulating that the remedy under Section 438 of CrPC cannot be resorted to by any personaccused of having committed an offence under Sections 376(3), 376-AB, 376-DA or 376-DB of the IPC.\\nix. The State Legislatures of Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have enacted State amendments toSection 438 of CrPC.\\nEvolution of the Safeguard of Anticipatory Bail:\\n10. In Shri Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia vs. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 565 (Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia), a Constitution Bench ofthis Court speaking through Chandrachud, C.J., observed that society has a vital \\x0c stake in preserving personal liberty aswell as investigational powers of the police and their relative importance at any given time depends upon the complexion andrestraints of political conditions. How best to balance these interests while determining the scope of Section 438 of CrPC wasthe focus of the said case while dealing with the historical background of the said provision.\\n10.1 The question of the grant of pre-arrest or anticipatory bail fell for consideration in the era when the Code of CriminalProcedure, 1898 was in vogue and the grant of such bail was governed by Sections 497 and 498 of the erstwhile CriminalProcedure Code. In Jamini Mullick vs. Emperor, (1909) ILR 36 Cal 174, the Calcutta High Court considered a case wherethe Presidency Magistrate had issued warrants for the arrest of certain persons as suspects in a murder case. The deceasedhad been found lying dead at night on the footpath and while at the inquest certain unknown persons were suspected, theMagistrate issued warrants when evidence casting suspicion on four individuals was produced. Therefore, the suspectedindividuals petitioned the Calcutta High Court for grant of bail. The Division Bench of Justices Mitra and Coxe granted pre-arrest bail to the suspected individuals. The judgment was prefaced by remarking that ordinarily the Court did not grant bailin cases of that kind, but emphasised on Section 498 of the erstwhile Criminal Procedure Code to hold that the High Courtcould exercise revisionary jurisdiction and grant bail to any person. It was noted that \\x0c the yardstick for the grant of relief ofbail was whether there existed reasonable grounds to believe that the accused were guilty of the offence. It was underlinedthat it was within the Magistrate’s jurisdiction to release the accused persons on bail but since the Magistrate did not considerthe inconsistencies in the evidence produced to implicate four different accused for the same crime, the High Court couldcorrect the Magistrate’s failure to exercise his jurisdiction. 10.2 The decision of the Calcutta High Court was followed by theFull Bench of the Lahore High Court in Hidayat Ullah Khan vs. The Crown, AIR 1949 Lah 77 wherein the petitioners beingapprehensive of institution of criminal proceedings had outlined reasons for the apprehension and sought pre-arrest bail tillthe disposal of the trial. The petitioners had averred that such arrest would amount to victimization, and would be a cause ofdisgrace and dishonour to them. Justice Cornelius underlined that the proposed prosecution was not in good faith and thatone of the petitioners was suffering from certain illnesses. The Crown had challenged the competence of the High Court togrant bail in anticipation of arrest, and that had occasioned the reference of the question from the Single Judge to the FullBench. The Full Bench framed the question as under:', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='acd04f41-7524-416d-b4a5-48ec7ff54e5a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '9', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='“Whether the High Court can grant any relief, and if so what, to a person seeking an order for bail, in anticipation ofhis arrest for an offence?” \\x0c 10.3 The Full Bench held that the High Court had power under Section 498 of theerstwhile Code of Criminal Procedure Code to make an order that a person who is suspected of an offence for whichhe may he arrested by a police-officer or a Court, shall be admitted to bail. The Full Bench laid emphasis on thedistinction between the jurisdiction of the police officer or Magistrate under Section 497 of the erstwhile CriminalProcedure Code ‘to release on bail’ and that of the High Court under Section 498 of the erstwhile Criminal ProcedureCode, to ‘direct that any person be admitted to bail.’ The Full Bench reasoned that the distinct use of a wideexpression signified that the High Court’s power includes not merely a power to revise the exercise of discretion bypolice-officers and Courts of first instance where bail has been refused, but also include clearly a power in the HighCourt to grant bail to persons to whom the police and the Courts of first instance are not permitted by S. 497 to grantbail, including those persons who are not in custody. The Full Bench struck a cautious note that ‘such cases wouldnecessarily be extremely rare, and by its very nature, the power to interfere with the discretion of an official such as apolice-officer exercising statutory powers perhaps at some remote place, at the very earliest stages of an investigation,would require to be exercised with the very greatest care.’ The Full Bench held that the Court needs to be satisfied thatif it stayed its hands until the police-officer had himself exercised his discretion in the matter and refused, upon arrest,to grant bail, a grave or irreparable \\x0c wrong or injustice might result, while at the same time preserving the interest ofjustice in so far as they related to the charge against such an accused person.\\n10.4 It is observed that the CrPC, 1898 did not contain any specific provision corresponding to the present Section438 of CrPC. Under the old Code, there was a sharp difference of opinion amongst the various High Courts on thequestion of whether Courts had the inherent power to pass an order of bail in anticipation of arrest, the preponderanceof view being that it did not have such power.\\n10.5 The concept of ‘anticipatory bail’ was clearly explicated vide the 41st Law Commission Report in the year 1969,whereby the Law Commission observed as such:\\n“39.9. The suggestion for directing the release of a person on bail prior to his arrest (commonly known as ‘anticipatorybail’) was carefully considered by us. Though there is a conflict of judicial opinion about the power of a Court to grantanticipatory bail, the majority view is that there is no such power under the existing provisions of the Code. Thenecessity for granting anticipatory bail arises mainly because sometimes influential persons try to implicate their rivalsin false causes for the purpose of disgracing them or for other purposes by getting them detained in jail for some days.In recent times, with the accentuation of political rivalry, this tendency is showing signs of steady increase. Apart fromfalse cases, where there are reasonable grounds for holding that a person accused of an offence is not likely toabscond, or otherwise misuse his liberty while on bail, there seems no justification to require him first to submit tocustody, remain in prison for some days and then apply for bail.\\n\\x0c  We recommend the acceptance of this suggestion.\\nWe are further of the view that this special power should be conferred only on the High Court and the Court ofSession, and that the order should take effect at the time of arrest or thereafter.” (emphasis added by us) 10.6Thereafter, the 48th Law Commission of India Report, 1972 titled ‘Some questions under the Code of CriminalProcedure Bill, 1970’ discussed the legislative proposal for inclusion of a provision for the grant of anticipatory bail.The Law Commission termed the same to be a ‘useful addition’ while adding a caveat that it ought to be exercisedonly in very exceptional cases. The Commission opined that the initial order should only be an interim order. Thatreasons for grant of the relief must be recorded and the Court ought to be satisfied that the direction is necessary in theinterest of justice. The Law Commission also expressed a view that it was imperative that the final order of grant ofanticipatory bail should only be made after notice to the Public Prosecutor so as to prevent the abuse of the process oflaw at the ‘instance of unscrupulous petitioners.’ 10.7 Observing that the crimes, the criminals and even thecomplainants can occasionally possess extraordinary features, in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia, it was stated that “when theeven flow of life becomes turbid, the police can be called upon to inquire into charges arising out of politicalantagonism”. The powerful processes of criminal law can then be perverted for achieving extraneous ends. Attendant\\x0c upon such investigations, when the police are not free agents within their sphere of duty, is a great amount ofinconvenience, harassment and humiliation that can even take the form of the parading of a respectable person inhandcuffs, apparently on way to a Court of justice.\\nThe foul deed is done when an adversary is exposed to social ridicule and obloquy, no matter when and whether a convictionis secured or is at all possible. It is in order to meet such situations, though not limited to these contingencies, that the powerto grant anticipatory bail was introduced into the Code of 1973.\\n10.8 Despite the inclusion of the provision for anticipatory bail in the CrPC after the acceptance of the aforesaidrecommendation, the expression “anticipatory bail” remained undefined in the CrPC. This Court in Balchand Jain observedthat “anticipatory bail” means “bail in anticipation of arrest.” This Court has exposited that an application for anticipatory bail', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='09a4d38d-a07c-4d00-b724-ae8c4346a7b8', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text=\"could be made by the accused either at a stage before an FIR is filed or at a stage when an FIR is registered but the chargesheet has not been filed, and the investigation is underway. Alternatively, it can be moved after the completion ofinvestigation. The stage of investigation has a bearing on the conditions to be imposed while granting the relief of anticipatorybail.\\n\\x0c 10.9 A crucial difference between the pre-arrest bail order under Section 438 of CrPC and the bail order under Sections437 and 439 of CrPC is the stages at which the bail order is passed.\\n11. Greater clarity on the contours of judicial discretion in the grant of pre-arrest bail emerged out of the judgement of theFull Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Gurbaksh Singh Sibia vs. State of Punjab, 1977 SCC OnLine P&H157. The Full Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court had rejected the application for bail while furnishing the reasonsthat the power under Section 438 of CrPC is of an extraordinary character and must be exercised sparingly in exceptionalcases. The said judgment was carried in appeal before this Court. Thereafter, the law on anticipatory bail was furthercrystallized by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia, where it disagreed with the reasoning of theFull Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court.\\n11.1 It was observed that since the denial of bail amounts to deprivation of personal liberty, the Court should lean against theimposition of unnecessary restrictions on the scope of Section 438 of CrPC, especially when not imposed by the legislaturein terms of the Section. It was observed that Section 438 of CrPC is a procedural provision which is concerned with thepersonal liberty of the individual, who is entitled to the benefit of the presumption of innocence since he is not, on the date\\x0c of his application for anticipatory bail, convicted of the offence in respect of which he seeks bail. An over-generousinfusion of constraints and conditions which are not to be found in Section 438 of CrPC can make its provisionsconstitutionally vulnerable since the right to personal freedom cannot be made to depend on compliance with unreasonablerestrictions. The beneficent provision contained in Section 438 of CrPC must be saved, not jettisoned. The considerationsfor grant of anticipatory bail were discussed in paragraph 31 of the said judgment which reads as under:\\n“31. In regard to anticipatory bail, if the proposed accusation appears to stem not from motives of furthering the endsof justice but from some ulterior motive, the object being to injure and humiliate the applicant by having him arrested,a direction for the release of the applicant on bail in the event of his arrest would generally be made. On the otherhand, if it appears likely, considering the antecedents of the applicant, that taking advantage of the order of anticipatorybail he will flee from justice, such an order would not be made. But the converse of these propositions is notnecessarily true. That is to say, it cannot be laid down as an inexorable rule that anticipatory bail cannot be grantedunless the proposed accusation appears to be actuated by mala fides; and, equally, that anticipatory bail must begranted if there is no fear that the applicant will abscond. There are several other considerations, too numerous toenumerate, the combined effect of which must weigh with the Court while granting or rejecting anticipatory bail. Thenature and seriousness of the proposed charges, the context of the events likely to lead to the making of the charges, areasonable possibility of the applicant's presence not being secured at the trial, a reasonable apprehension thatwitnesses will be tampered with and “the larger interests of the public or the State” are some of the \\x0c  considerationswhich the Court has to keep in mind while deciding an application for anticipatory bail.” 11.2 On the question ofevaluation of the consideration as to whether the applicant is likely to abscond, it was observed that there can be nopresumption that the wealthy and the mighty will submit themselves to trial and the humble and the poor will run awayfrom the course of justice, any more than there can be a presumption that the former are not likely to commit a crimeand the latter are more likely to commit it.\\nUltimately, the Constitution Bench clarified the following points in paragraphs 35 to 39 which are extracted as under:\\n“35. Section 438(1) of the Code lays down a condition which has to be satisfied before anticipatory bail can begranted. The applicant must show that he has “reason to believe” that he may be arrested for a non- bailable offence.The use of the expression “reason to believe” shows that the belief that the applicant may be so arrested must befounded on reasonable grounds. Mere ‘fear’ is not ‘belief”, for which reason it is not enough for the applicant to showthat he has some sort of a vague apprehension that some one is going to make an accusation against him, in pursuanceof which he may be arrested. The grounds on which the belief of the applicant is based that he may be arrested for anon-bailable offence, must be capable of being examined by the Court objectively, because it is then alone that theCourt can determine whether the applicant has reason to believe that he may be so arrested. Section 438(1), therefore,cannot be invoked on the basis of vague and general allegations, as if to arm oneself in perpetuity against a possiblearrest. Otherwise, the number of applications for anticipatory bail will be as large as, at any rate, the adult populace.Anticipatory bail is a device to secure the individuals liberty; it is neither a passport to the commission of crimes nor ashield against any and all kinds of accusations, likely or unlikely.\\n\\x0c  36. Secondly, if an application for anticipatory bail is made to the High Court or the Court of Session it must applyits own mind to the question and decide whether a case has been made out for granting such relief. It cannot leave thequestion for the decision of the Magistrate concerned under Section 437 of the Code, as and when an occasion arises.Such a course will defeat the very object of Section 438.\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='d775a649-c63e-473e-a51c-ac0d3409ced9', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '11', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='37. Thirdly, the filing of a first information report is not a condition precedent to the exercise of the power underSection 438. The imminence of a likely arrest founded on a reasonable belief can be shown to exist even if an FIR isnot yet filed.\\n38. Fourthly, anticipatory bail can be granted even after an FIR is filed, so long as the applicant has not been arrested.\\n39. Fifthly, the provisions of Section 438 cannot be invoked after the arrest of the accused. The grant of “anticipatorybail” to an accused who is under arrest involves a contradiction in terms, insofar as the offence or offences for whichhe is arrested, are concerned. After arrest, the accused must seek his remedy under Section 437 or Section 439 of theCode, if he wants to be released on bail in respect of the offence or offences for which he is arrested.” 11.3 Cautioningthe Courts against granting blanket order of anticipatory bail so as to cover or protect any and every kind of allegedlyunlawful activity, or eventuality, it was observed that there must be a genuine apprehension of arrest by the applicantand there must be something tangible to go by on the basis of which it can be said that the applicant’s apprehension ofarrest is genuine. Otherwise, a blanket order of anticipatory bail is bound to cause serious interference with both theright and the duty of the police in the matter of investigation \\x0c because regardless of what kind of offence is alleged tohave been committed by the applicant, when an order of bail comprehends allegedly unlawful activity of anydescription whatsoever, this will prevent the police from arresting the applicant even if he commits, say, a murder inthe presence of the public. Therefore, the Court which grants anticipatory bail must take care to specify the offence oroffences in respect of which alone the order will be effective. The power should not be exercised in a vacuum.\\n12. While adjudicating on a question as to whether the protection granted under Section 438 of CrPC should be limitedto a fixed period so as to enable the person to surrender before the trial Court or not, a Constitution Bench of thisCourt in Sushila Aggarwal took note of later doctrinal developments as well as reports of the Law Commission ofIndia. In this case, two questions were considered by the Constitutional Bench:\\n1. Whether the protection granted to a person under Section 438 of CrPC should be limited to a fixed period so as toenable the person to surrender before the trial Court and seek regular bail?\\n2. Whether the life of an anticipatory bail order should end at the time and stage when the accused is summoned bythe Court?\\n12.1 Regarding the first question, this Court held that the protection granted to a person under Section 438 of CrPC shouldnot invariably be \\x0c limited to a fixed period; it should enure in favour of the accused without any restriction on time. Normalconditions under Section 437(3) read with Section 438(2) of CrPC should be imposed. If there are specific facts or featuresin regard to any offence, it is open for the Court to impose any appropriate condition (including fixed nature of relief, or itsbeing tied to an event), etc. 12.2 As regards the second question referred to this Court, it was held that the life or duration ofan anticipatory bail order does not end normally at the time and stage when the accused is summoned by the Court, or whencharges are framed, but can continue till the end of the trial. Again, if there are any special or peculiar features necessitatingthe Court to limit the tenure of anticipatory bail, it is open for it to do so.\\n12.3 The following clarifications were also issued which are to be borne in mind while dealing with an application underSection 438 of CrPC:\\n“a) When an application is made seeking anticipatory bail, it should be based on concrete facts (and not vague orgeneral allegations) relatable to one or other specific offence. The application should contain bare essential factsrelating to the offence, and why the applicant reasonably apprehends arrest, as well as his side of the story. This isnecessary in order to evaluate the threat or apprehension, its gravity or seriousness and the appropriateness of anycondition that may have to be imposed. An application should be moved prior to the filing of an FIR, so long as thefacts are clear and there is reasonable basis for apprehending arrest.\\n\\x0c b) It is advisable for the Court, to issue notice to the Public Prosecutor and obtain facts, even while granting limitedinterim anticipatory bail.\\nc) Nothing in Section 438 CrPC, compels or obliges Courts to impose conditions limiting relief in terms of time, orupon filing of FIR, or recording of statement of any witness, by the police, during investigation or inquiry, etc. TheCourt has to consider the nature of the offence, the role of the person, the likelihood of his influencing the course ofinvestigation, or tampering with evidence (including intimidating witnesses), likelihood of fleeing justice (such as', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='b36d5c99-fdd4-4d68-a901-a564027fdde2', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '12', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='leaving the country), etc. By virtue of Section 438(2), the Courts would be justified and ought to impose conditionsspelt out in Section 437(3). Conditions which limit the grant of anticipatory bail may be imposed, depending on thefacts of the case but not be invariably imposed.\\nd) Courts ought to be generally guided by considerations such as the nature and gravity of the offences, the roleattributed to the applicant, and the facts of the case. Whether to grant or not is a matter of discretion and similarly ifbail is to be granted, the kind of conditions to be imposed or not to be imposed depends upon the facts of each caseand subject to the discretion of the Court.\\ne) Anticipatory bail granted can, depending on the conduct and behaviour of the accused, continue after filing of thecharge-sheet till the end of trial.\\nf) An order of anticipatory bail should not be blanket in the sense that it should not enable the accused to commitfurther offences and claim relief of indefinite protection from arrest. It must be confined to the particular offence oroffences relatable to an incident, for which apprehension of arrest is sought. It cannot operate in respect of a futureincident that involves commission of an offence.\\ng) The grant of an anticipatory bail does not in any manner limit or restrict the rights or duties of the \\x0c  police orinvestigating agency, to investigate into the charges against the person who seeks and is granted pre-arrest bail.\\nh) The observations in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia regarding limited custody or deemed custody in the context of Section27 of the Evidence Act, does not require the accused to separately surrender and seek regular bail.\\ni) It is open to the police or the investigating agency to move the Court concerned, which grants anticipatory bail, for adirection under Section 439(2) to arrest the accused, in the event of violation of any term, such as absconding, non-\\ncooperating during investigation, evasion, intimidation or inducement to witnesses with a view to influence outcome of theinvestigation or trial, etc.\\nj) The correctness of an order granting bail can be considered by the appellate or superior Court at the behest of the State orinvestigating agency, and set aside the same on the ground that the Court granting it did not consider material facts or crucialcircumstances. This does not amount to cancellation in terms of Section 439(2) CrPC.\\nk) In Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre vs. State of Maharashtra, (2011) 1 SCC 694 (and other similar judgments), it was heldthat no restrictive conditions at all can be imposed, while granting anticipatory bail are hereby overruled. Likewise, thedecision in Salauddin Abdulsamad Shaikh vs. State of Maharashtra, (1996) 1 SCC 667 and subsequent decisions which laiddown restrictive conditions, or terms limiting the grant of anticipatory bail, to a period of time were overruled.”\\n13. In Nathu Singh, the complainants filed a Special Leave Petition challenging the order of the High Court of Judicature atAllahabad, which dismissed the anticipatory bail application filed by the accused \\x0c and on granting them 90 days to surrenderbefore the trial Court and to seek regular bail, granted them protection from coercive action during the said period of 90days.\\n13.1 The Court after referring to the Constitution Bench Judgment in the case of Sushila Aggarwal considered the proviso toSection 438(1) of CrPC and observed that the proviso does not create any rights or restrictions. It is only clarificatory innature. The Court then considered the question whether, while dismissing an application seeking anticipatory bail, the pleamade by the applicant seeking protection for some time as he or she is the primary caregiver or breadwinner of his or herfamily members and needs to make arrangements for them and therefore even if a strict case for grant of anticipatory bail isnot made out, and rather, where the investigating authority has made out a case for custodial investigation, whether the Courtmay exercise its discretion to grant protection against arrest for a limited period. It was observed that if such an order has tobe passed, it must be narrowly tailored to protect the interests of the applicant while taking into consideration the concerns ofthe investigating authority and must be supported by reasons.\\n13.2 It was held that in the impugned order of the High Court, it had dismissed the application seeking anticipatory bail onthe basis of the nature and gravity of the offence by not granting protection from arrest \\x0c without assigning any reason.Secondly, the granting of the relief for a period of 90 days did not take into consideration the concerns of the investigatingagency, the complainant or the proviso under Section 438(1) of CrPC, which necessitates that the Court pass such anexceptional discretionary protection order for the shortest duration that is reasonably required. A period of 90 days, or threemonths, is an unreasonable period. Therefore, the impugned orders were set aside leaving it open to the investigating agencyto proceed with the matters in accordance with law and complete the investigation. If the applicants were in the meanwhile injudicial custody, their applications for regular bail could be considered by the competent Court, uninfluenced by theobservations made in the order.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='8565fd63-7164-4f9c-891c-eac417a83e4d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '13', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='14. After marshalling the entire range of juridical materials on the subject of anticipatory bail and the perception of its abuse,the Constitution Bench in Sushila Aggarwal held the judgements of this Court that postulated greater limitations on the grantof anticipatory bail to be not good law.\\n15. The upshot of the above discussion is that the march of criminal law has been towards chiselling an equitous remedy thatstrikes a delicate balance between the imperative of personal liberty with that of effective administration of criminal law.\\n\\x0c 16. This Court, while being seized of a challenge to grant extra- territorial anticipatory bail, had kept the question of lawopen in the following two cases:\\n(i) In Brojen Gogol, this Court considered the Assam Police’s challenge to the Bombay High Court’s grant ofanticipatory bail to an accused who was allegedly involved in offences perpetrated in Guwahati.\\nAccordingly, it held that the anticipatory bail application ought to be made before the Gauhati High Court as the allegedactivities had been perpetrated within its territorial jurisdiction. Consequently, this Court set aside the impugned order of theBombay High Court granting anticipatory bail on the ground that the prosecuting agency was not heard. However, this Courtheld that it did not think it necessary to decide whether the Bombay High Court had jurisdiction to entertain the anticipatorybail application. It was held that status quo would be maintained until the High Court of Gauhati passed appropriate order(s)on the anticipatory bail application.\\n(ii) This Court also had the occasion to adjudicate upon Teesta Atul Setalvad vs. State of Maharashtra, Special LeavePetition (Criminal) No. 1770 of 2014, whereby the applicant seeking extra- territorial anticipatory bail had appealed againstthe Bombay High Court’s order. The Bombay High Court had permitted the applicant for extra-territorial anticipatory bail tomove before the appropriate Court in Gujarat for the said relief and granted transit bail for four weeks so \\x0c as to enable thesame. This Court disposed of the Special Leave Petition No. 1770 of 2014 on 24.02.2014 without interfering with theBombay High Court’s judgement while observing that the question of law about the jurisdiction of the High Court was keptopen.\\n(iii) Therefore, the present appeal constitutes the third of the cases where this crucial question of public importance has beenraised before this Court by the appellant who is the complainant.

Therefore, when an accused                                           is arrested in accordance                                           with the order of a Court and                                           whereas the accused needs                                           to be tried in some other                                           competent Court having                                           jurisdiction       in       the                                           aforementioned matter, the                                           accused is given bail for the                                           transitory period i.e., the                                           time period required for the                                           accused to reach that                                           competent Court from the                                           place he is arrested in.                                           The regular Court would                                           consider such anticipatory                                           bail, on its own merits and                                           shall        decide       such                                           anticipatory bail application.                                           Therefore, it could be easily                                           said that transit bail is a                                           temporary relief which an                                           accused gets for a certain                                           period of time. The High                                           Court concluded that there                                           is no fetter on the part of the                                           High Court in granting a\\n      Case Name            High Court        Outcome and Reasoning                                           transit anticipatory bail to                                           enable the applicants to                                           approach       the      Courts                                           including the High Court                                           within whose jurisdiction                                           the offence is alleged to have                                           been committed and the                                           case is registered.16.

The above table is a testament to the rich jurisprudential discussion that has arisen out of the limited legislative guidanceregarding the expression ‘the High Court or the Court of Session.’ The analysis of the above case law is as under:\\na. The Patna High Court in Syed Zafrul Hassan stressed on the plain meaning of Section 438 of CrPC to hold that ‘theHigh Court’ or ‘the Court of Session’ cannot mean “any” High Court or Court of Session. Therefore, it held that theapplication for direction under Section 438 of CrPC was not maintainable at Patna Bench of the Patna High Courtbecause the FIR was registered at the Jhinkpani police station which falls in the district of Singhbhum. The matter thuscame squarely within the jurisdiction of the Bench of the Patna \\x0c  High Court at Ranchi. The High Court stressed onthe principle that a criminal Court takes cognizance of the offence and not of individual offenders, vide RaghubansDubey. Therefore, the High Court emphasized upon the practical difficulties if the jurisdiction of criminal Court wasdetermined by ‘the shady or evasive movements of the offender’, there would be ‘judicial chaos and an inherentconflict betwixt the comity of Courts.’ The High Court cautioned that if the application for anticipatory bail was', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='49c5e9bc-95d8-4756-9c1a-634564a5a25f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '20', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='maintainable outside the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court, ‘a fugitive offender may well move from Court toCourt ad infinitum and if he fails in one jurisdiction then on to another until he secures relief in the last.’ b. CalcuttaHigh Court in Sadhan Chandra Kolay relied upon Article 214 of the Constitution which states that there shall be a HighCourt for each State and had categorically held that the Sessions Judge has got no authority to exercise the power orjurisdiction under Section 438 of CrPC beyond the local limits of the territorial jurisdiction of the Sessions-Division.\\nc. The facts in Honey Preet Insan are peculiar to the extent that the relief of interim protection was denied because theapplicant was at large and had categorically refused to join investigation. d. At this juncture it may be noted that theaforementioned approach was supported by the Justice V.S. Malimath Committee’s Report on \\x0c  Reforms in CriminalJustice System. In section 7.33, page 121, the Committee had proposed that provision regarding anticipatory bail may beretained subject to two conditions: that the Court would hear the Public Prosecutor; and that the petition for anticipatory bailshould be heard only by the Court of competent jurisdiction. e. Another set of judgements, such as of the Delhi High Courtin Surya Pratap Singh, Allahabad High Court in Ajay Agarwal, Amita Garg, Bombay High Court in Teesta Atul Setalvad,Nikita Jacob and Manda Suresh Parulekar, highlight the transit anticipatory bail approach. In these cases, the High Courtgranted transit bail and ruled that the grant of protection from arrest beyond the local limits of their jurisdiction is limited tothe extent of consideration of bail for the transitional period. In other words, the High Courts in their respective judgementhas read the scheme of administration of criminal justice and the provision for anticipatory bail in a conjoint sense, therebylimiting the relief of extra-territorial anticipatory bail to a definite interim period. f. Another line of judgments namely, by theDelhi High Court in Pritam Singh; Kerala High Court in C.L. Mathew; Bombay High Court in N.K. Nayar; Calcutta HighCourt In Re: Benod Ranjan Sinha and Karnataka High Court in L.R. Naidu and Gameskraft Technologies have read theexpression ‘the High Court or the Court of Session’ in Section 438 of CrPC as different and disjoint \\x0c  from the generalscheme of criminal procedure, thereby deciding in favor of grant of protection from arrest to remove the apprehension ofarrest at a particular place, irrespective of the territorial jurisdiction to take cognizance of the criminal offence in question.The constitutional imperative of safeguarding personal liberty was emphasised and it was noted that a person may apprehendarrest at a place including at a place other than the one within the jurisdiction in which an alleged offence has beencommitted. The High Courts in their respective judgments adverted to the lack of legislative qualification of the expression‘the High Court or the Court of Session’ to mean that it extends to any High Court or Court of Session in whose jurisdictionan arrest is apprehended by a person against whom an FIR has been filed. Position of law overseas:\\n19. Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 establishes that “no one shall be subjected to arbitraryarrest, detention or exile.” Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the United Nations, 1966establishes that “all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignityof the human person”. These provisions in the International Human Rights instruments are a necessary safeguard against thereality of arbitrary and inhumane deprivation of liberty and the inability of those thus deprived to benefit from legal resourcesand \\x0c constitutional guarantees that they are entitled to for the conduct of their defence as required by law in any judicialsystem and by application of international human rights standards.\\n20. Comparative legal study on law of criminal procedure presents India as an exemplar with respect to the provision for pre-arrest bail. It would be useful to consider how other jurisdictions have dealt with the issue of pre-arrest bail as under:\\n(a) Possibly, the only known case of an application for a pre-arrest bail bond in the United States of America is In re:Sturman, 1984.604 F. Supp. 278. (F. E. Devine (1990) Anticipatory Bail: An Indian Civil Liberties Innovation,International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice, 14:1-2, 107-114). The U.S. District Court for theNorthern District of Ohio presumed that the applicant’s motion was made to spare himself of the embarrassment ofarrest.\\nIn denying the motion as premature, the Chief District Judge commented that the \"setting of a bail bond is to insure theaccused\\'s presence at trial; it is not designed as a means to avoid arrest.\"\\n(b) In the United Kingdom, the common law of arrest was codified in Section 2 of the Criminal Law Act, 1967. The salientfacets of Section 2 are that for an arrest to be lawful, the offence must be one carrying a penalty of five years imprisonment(an “arrestable offence”); and there must, at the minimum, be suspicion on \\x0c  reasonable grounds that the person to bearrested either has committed, is committing or is about to commit the offence. It may be wielded as a tool to prevent thedestruction of evidence, interference with witnesses or warning accomplices who have yet to be arrested. When there isreason to suspect an offence may be repeated, especially though not exclusively in the case of violent offences, it may beused to prevent such repetition.\\n(c) The United Kingdom’s Royal Commission Report on Criminal Procedure (Philips Commission)(1981) - citedaffirmatively by this Court in Joginder Kumar vs. State of U.P., (1994) 4 SCC 260, para 17-19 - proposed to restrict thecircumstances in which the police could exercise the power of arrest with warrant to deprive a person of his liberty to thosein which it would genuinely be necessary to enable them to execute their duties of preventing the commission of offences,investigating crime, and bringing suspected offenders before the Courts; and to simplify, clarify and rationalise the existingstatutory powers of arrest, confirming the present rationale for the use of those powers. It stated as follows:\\n“In attempting to limit the power of arrest, we have no intention of inhibiting the police from fulfilling their functions ofdetecting and preventing crime. But we do seek to alter the practice whereby the inevitable sequence that would follow', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='e25d3f9d-598c-4118-aab6-3fdb7f184a37', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '21', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='upon the arising of a reasonable suspicion is arrest, followed by being taken to the station, often to be searched,fingerprinted and photographed. The evidence submitted to us supports the view of the Police \\x0c  Complaints Board,expressed in their triennial report, that police officers are so involved with the process of arrest and detention that theyfail at times to understand the sense of alarm and dismay felt by some of those who suffer such treatment. Arrestrepresents a major disruption to the suspect’s life… That disruption cannot, in our view, be justified if it is notnecessary to take him to the station for one or more of the following reasons: to find out his name and address; toprevent the continuation or repetition of the offence; to protect persons or property; to preserve evidence inconnection with that offence; to dispel reasonable suspicion or to turn it into a prima facie case.” (para 3.75) TheRoyal Commission underlined the necessity principle to diminish the possibility of arbitrary arrest, thereby requiringthe police officer receiving the suspect in his custody to enquire as to whether it would be essential to keep the arrestedperson at the police station on the basis of the following criteria:\\n(i) the person’s unwillingness to identify himself so that a summons may be served upon him;\\n(ii) the need to prevent the continuation or repetition of that offence;\\n(iii) the need to protect the arrested person himself, or other persons or property;\\n(iv) the need to secure or preserve evidence of or relating to that offence or to obtain such evidence from the suspectby questioning him; and\\n\\x0c  (v) the likelihood of the person failing to appear at Court to answer any charge made against him.\\n(d) The Queen’s Bench in Regina vs. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex Parte LeecH, (1994) Q.B. 198held that it was a principle of fundamental importance that every citizen had a right of unimpeded access to a Court,and to a solicitor for the purpose of receiving advice and assistance in connection therewith.\\n(e) In Kenya, while there are no specific provisions on anticipatory bail, these are instead enshrined in constitutionalprovisions under the Bill of Rights. The Constitution of Kenya, 2010 provides for:\\n(i) Bail of arrested person under Article 49(1)(h)\\n(ii) Appropriate relief under Article 23(3) for breach of the Bill of Rights.\\nTherefore, wherever the remedy has been considered, the Courts have applied the threshold applicable to an application filedseeking to prevent the violation or threatened violation of rights under Articles 23 and 165(3) of the Kenyan Constitution.\\n(f) The High Court of Kenya in Coroline Kuthie Karanja vs. Director Public Prosecutions, (2021) eKLR extensively referredto Section 438 of CrPC and stated that the constitutional Courts of India had widely construed the fundamental aspects ofanticipatory bail to be \\x0c  of great importance and anchored to the right to life and liberty of a person. The High Court alsoemphatically reiterated its constitutional duty to go to the length and breadth of the Constitution to protect the rights andfundamental freedoms of Kenyans where need be, but it emphasized the need to be alive to its obligation not to curtail theother organs of the State from carrying out their constitutional mandate. Accordingly, the High Court granted anticipatory bailon the ground that the applicant therein had been arrested in the past and was out of custody on bond for a charge that wassimilar to the charge that she apprehended the arrest for.\\nPersonal Liberty and Access to Justice:\\nWhile we have analysed key judgments of this Court as well as various High Courts across the country on thepertinent question/issue raised in this case, we must also look at the same from the angle of personal liberty and accessto justice. Article 39 A of the Constitution of India deals with equal justice and free legal aid, which can be construedto be a specie of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which deals with right to life and liberty. For sake ofimmediate reference, Article 39A is extracted as under:\\n“39A. Equal justice and free legal aid.- The State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice,on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='aadfd029-308c-42b8-b994-c9ee15507411', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '22', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text=\"any other way, to ensure \\x0c  that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economicor other disabilities.”\\n21. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Anita Kushwaha vs. Pushap Sudan, (2016) 8 SCC 509 held access to justiceto be encompassed within the right to life under Article 21 and observed as under:\\n“31. Given the fact that pronouncements mentioned above have interpreted and understood the word “life” appearingin Article 21 of the Constitution on a broad spectrum of rights considered incidental and/or integral to the right to life,there is no real reason why access to justice should be considered to be falling outside the class and category of thesaid rights, which already stands recognised as being a part and parcel of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. If“life” implies not only life in the physical sense but a bundle of rights that makes life worth living, there is no juristic orother basis for holding that denial of “access to justice” will not affect the quality of human life so as to take access tojustice out of the purview of right to life guaranteed under Article 21. We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding thataccess to justice is indeed a facet of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. We need only add thataccess to justice may as well be the facet of the right guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution, which guaranteesequality before law and equal protection of laws to not only citizens but non-citizens also. We say so because equalitybefore law and equal protection of laws is not limited in its application to the realm of executive action that enforcesthe law. It is as much available in relation to proceedings before Courts and tribunal and adjudicatory fora where law isapplied and justice administered. The citizen's inability to access Courts or any other adjudicatory mechanism providedfor determination of rights and obligations is bound to result in denial of the guarantee contained in Article 14 both inrelation to equality before law as well as equal protection of laws. Absence of any adjudicatory mechanism or theinadequacy of such mechanism, \\x0c  needless to say, is bound to prevent those looking for enforcement of their right toequality before laws and equal protection of the laws from seeking redress and thereby negate the guarantee ofequality before laws or equal protection of laws and reduce it to a mere teasing illusion. Article 21 of the Constitutionapart, access to justice can be said to be part of the guarantee contained in Article 14 as well.” The Constitution Benchenumerated four facets of access to justice as:\\n“33. Four main facets that, in our opinion, constitute the essence of access to justice are:\\n(i) the State must provide an effective adjudicatory mechanism;\\n(ii) the mechanism so provided must be reasonably accessible in terms of distance;\\n(iii) the process of adjudication must be speedy;\\nand\\n(iv) the litigant's access to the adjudicatory process must be affordable.”\\n22. Therefore, this Court has elevated the provision of a just adjudicatory forum for a citizen to agitate his grievanceand seek adjudication of what he may perceive as a breach of his right to the level of a fundamental right. Not only isthe adjudicatory forum supposed to be effective in its functioning and just, fair and objective in its approach, but italso must be conveniently approachable and affordable by observing as under:\\n“35. The forum/mechanism so provided must, having regard to the hierarchy of Courts/tribunals, be reasonablyaccessible in terms of distance for access to justice since so much depends upon the ability of the litigant to placehis/her grievance effectively before the Court/tribunal/Court/competent authority to \\x0c  grant such a relief. (See D.K.Basu v. State of W.B. [D.K. Basu v. State of W.B., (2015) 8 SCC 744 :\\n(2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 824] )”\\n23. It was also emphasised that access to justice would, therefore, be a constitutional value of any significance andutility only if the delivery of justice to the citizen is speedy, for otherwise, the right to access justice is no more than ahollow slogan of no use or inspiration for the citizen. It was held as under:\\n“38. Access to justice will again be no more than an illusion if the adjudicatory mechanism provided is so expensive asto deter a disputant from taking resort to the same.

The answer to the points for consideration raised herein would emerge from the construction that is afforded to theexpression ‘the High Court or the Court of Session’ in Section 438 of CrPC. It was submitted before us that the use ofthe definite article ‘the’ before High Court and Court of Session must mean that High Court and that Court of Sessionwhich exercises territorial jurisdiction over the area where an offence has been committed.\\n25. It indeed is a trite rule of statutory interpretation that penal statutes are to be construed strictly. When acts are tobe made penal \\x0c and are to be visited with loss or impairment of life, liberty, or property, it may well be argued thatpersonal liberty requires clear and exact definition of the offence. Furthermore, appropriate care must be taken toadopt an interpretation which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. In this regard, the followingcontextual aspects may be noted:\\na. The CrPC explicitly defines the ‘local limits’ and ‘local jurisdiction’ within which the Magistrate may exercisejurisdiction. b. Even though the High Court is defined in CrPC, no provision explicitly defines its territorial jurisdictionwhich has to be discerned from the Constitution of India.\\nc. Section 438(1)(iv) of CrPC makes explicit the legislative intent to prevent humiliation of the persons who apprehendarrest, especially in politically motivated or malicious prosecutions or in false cases. d. The mischief that Section 438of CrPC seeks to remedy is apprehension of wrongful arrest.\\n26. Therefore, we ought to provide sufficient amplitude to the expression ‘reason to believe that he may be arrested’,and look at the setting in which the words are used and the circumstances under which the law came to be passed todecide whether something implicit is behind the words used which controls the literal meaning of such words.\\nAn interpretation giving rise to an absolute bar on the jurisdiction of a Court of Session or a High Court to grant interimanticipatory bail for \\x0c an offence committed outside the territorial confines of a High Court or Court of Session may lead toan anomalous and unjust consequence for bona fide applicants who may be victims of wrongful, mala fide or politicallymotivated prosecution.\\n27. Furthermore, the fundamental right to personal liberty and access to justice, which are constitutionally recognised andstatutorily preserved through the presence of jurisdiction with superior Courts, would be undermined through such arestrictive interpretation. While construing a statute, constitutional Courts are obliged to render a contextually sensitiveconstruction that preserves and furthers core constitutional values.\\n28. Reliance in this regard may be placed on the dicta of this Court in Central Inland Water Transport Corporation vs. BrojoNath Ganguly, (1986) 3 SCC 156:\\n“It is thus clear that the principles governing public policy must be and are capable, on proper occasion, of expansionor modification. Practices which were considered perfectly normal at one time have today become obnoxious andoppressive to public conscience. If there is no head of public policy which covers a case, then the Court must inconsonance with public conscience and in keeping with public good and public interest declare such practice to beopposed to public policy. Above all, in deciding any case which may not be covered by authority our Courts havebefore them the beacon light of the Preamble to the Constitution. Lacking precedent, the Court can always be guidedby that light and the principles underlying the Fundamental Rights and \\x0c  the Directive Principles enshrined in ourConstitution.” (emphasis by us)\\n29. We are mindful that this Court’s jurisprudence on Section 438 of CrPC, particularly in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia andSushila Aggarwal, has towed the line of wise exercise of judicial discretion while interpreting the silence of the Parliament toimply an intention to facilitate the grant of essential procedural relief to secure the right to life and personal liberty underArticle 21. Whilst the Constitution Bench in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia ruled against the procedural and substantive restrictionson the grant of relief of anticipatory bail, the Constitution Bench in Sushila Aggarwal held that the period of anticipatory bailcannot be limited, and may extend till the end of trial. The judgement of the Constitution Bench in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia, inpara 13, emphasises that, ‘the High Court and the Court of Session to whom the application for anticipatory bail is madeought to be left free in the exercise of their judicial discretion to grant bail if they consider it fit so to do on the particular factsand circumstances of the case and on such conditions as the case may warrant.’', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='2fc5e9ed-9ee9-4230-8cd4-92b603d6b98e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '24', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='30. Maxwell in his treatise on Interpretation of Statutes (10 edn.), page 284 states that “the tendency of modern decisions onthe whole is to narrow materially the difference between strict and beneficial construction”. It follows that criminal statutessuch as the CrPC are \\x0c interpreted with rational regard to the aim and intention of the legislature. What has to be borne inthe judicial mind is that the interpretation of all statutes should be favorable to personal liberty subject to fair and effectiveadministration of criminal justice.\\n31. A remedy such as anticipatory bail secures citizens afflicted in difficult life circumstances – and such difficulties wouldkeep evolving as our collective lives and legal systems become more complex. We deem it fit to distinguish between exerciseof jurisdiction arising out of apprehension of arrest and jurisdiction conferred consequent to the “commission and cognizanceof an offence”. If the Parliament intended that the expression ‘the High Court or the Court of Session’, to mean only theCourt that takes cognizance of an offence, then the Parliament would have made this abundantly clear. The omission of anyqualification of the expression ‘the High Court or the Court of Session,’ ought to be constructed in a fashion that furthers theconstitutional ideal of safeguarding personal liberty. It would be in furtherance of fostering personal liberty enshrined inArticle 21 of the Constitution of India in entrusting a wider jurisdiction to the Court of Session and the High Court in thegrant of anticipatory bail, than in foreclosing the same by restructuring the exercise of jurisdiction in the matter of grant ofanticipatory bail.\\n\\x0c 32. In the context of the contentions advanced by Dr. Manish Singhvi that the unbridled power to grant extra-territorialanticipatory bail would cause inconsistencies because of the varying State amendments to Section 438 of CrPC, we note thatthe application of the provision for anticipatory bail in the State of Uttar Pradesh had been omitted vide the enactment of theCode of Criminal Procedure (Uttar Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1976. The Uttar Pradesh State Legislature applied Section438 of CrPC vide enactment of Code of Criminal Procedure (Uttar Pradesh Amendment) Act, 2018, pursuant to ‘continuousdemand for its revival’, writ petitions before the High courts, and recommendations of the Uttar Pradesh State LawCommission in its third report in 2009. We also note that the Code of Criminal Procedure (Uttar Pradesh Amendment) Act,2022 makes the provision of anticipatory bail inapplicable (a) in case of offences arising out of,— (i) The Unlawful Activities(Prevention) Act, 1967; (ii) The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985; (iii) The Official Secrets Act, 1923;(iv) The Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986; (v) The Protection of Children fromSexual Offences Act, 2012; (b) to those offences in which the death sentence may be awarded; (c) to the offences of rapeand illegal sexual intercourse enumerated in sections 376, 376-A, 376-AB, 376-B, 376-C, 376-D, 376- DA, 376-DB, 376-Eof the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\\n\\x0c 33. Considering that the nature of criminal law regime in India, entwined with State amendments, the exercise of thejurisdiction for grant of extra-territorial anticipatory bail must be cognizant of the possibility of forum shopping. We alsodeem it necessary to take note of the evolution of the law on inter-state arrests, as this lies at the heart of ‘apprehension ofarrest,’ for which the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court and Court of Session are attracted in case the accusedresides in or is located in a territorial jurisdiction different from the jurisdiction in which cognizance of crime is taken by theCourt of competent jurisdiction.\\n34. Section 48 of CrPC permits the police to pursue an accused in other jurisdictions. A police officer, for the purpose ofarresting without a warrant, one whom he is allowed to arrest, may pursue an individual anywhere in India. Prior to effectingthe arrest outside a particular jurisdiction, the police is obligated to secure the transit remand i.e. the remand of the accused,for taking him from one place to another in their own custody, usually for the purpose of producing him before theconcerned magistrate who has jurisdiction to try/commit the case. The primary purpose of such a remand is to enable thepolice to shift the person in custody from the place of arrest to the place where the matter can be investigated and tried.However in various cases, the police and investigating agencies have failed to exercise necessary restraint while functioningwithin their legal remit. It is for the aforesaid reason that an \\x0c accused apprehending arrest seeks pre-arrest bail. The Courtsin India have to be vigilant about such applications being filed particularly when a person alleged to have committed anoffence can be proceeded with by setting the criminal law in motion in a place other than the place where the offence hasactually occurred. In such circumstances the Courts must balance the interest of the accused in the context of the salutaryprinciple of access to justice which is a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution as well as a Directive Principle of State Policy,especially Article 39(A). More importantly, it is a facet of Article 14 of the Constitution which guarantees to every person inthe country, equality before the law and equal protection of the law.\\n35. In this case, we are concerned with what is loosely termed as ‘transit anticipatory bail’. As we have seen, the expression‘anticipatory bail’ is not defined in the CrPC though it is traceable to Section 438 of CrPC This Court in Balchand Jain haddefined anticipatory bail to mean bail in anticipation of arrest. The Constitution Bench in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia has held thatfiling of FIR is not a condition precedent for exercising power under Section 438 of CrPC What is required for invocation ofpower under Section 438 is that the person seeking anticipatory bail should show reasonable belief of imminent arrest. If theexpression ‘anticipatory bail’ is not a defined expression, then it is quite but natural that the larger expression ‘transitanticipatory bail’ would not find any exposition in the CrPC. Perhaps the \\x0c need and necessity for transit anticipatory bailhas occasioned because the police has been conferred power under the CrPC to pursue an accused in other jurisdictions.Immediately upon affecting the arrest of a person outside the jurisdiction where the offence is registered, the police isobligated to secure a transit remand. The arrested person has to be produced before the nearest magistrate. If such amagistrate finds that he has no jurisdiction to try the case in which the accused has been arrested, he may order the accusedto be forwarded to a magistrate having the jurisdiction to try the case or to commit it for trial. Thus, the police is obligated tosecure a transit remand of the accused for taking him from the place where he is arrested to the place where the crime isregistered, for production before the competent magistrate in terms of the requirement of Article 22.

It appears that from the aforesaid requirement of transit remand, hasarisen the necessity of ‘transit anticipatory bail’ for, an affected person cannot be without a remedy.\\n35.1. The word ‘transit’ is derived from the Latin word transitus which means passage from one place to another. Since theword ‘transit’ is an undefined expression in CrPC, we may take recourse to the dictionary meaning of the word ‘transit’. TheConcise Oxford English Dictionary, 10th Edition, Revised, defines the word ‘transit’ to mean \\x0c carrying of people or thingsfrom one place to another; the conveyance of passengers on public transport; an act of passing through or across a place.‘Transited’ or ‘transiting’ would mean pass across or through. Similarly, the word ‘transition’ means the process of changingfrom one state or condition to another. Likewise, the adjective ‘transitory’ means not permanent; short-lived. An usefulexample of the above expression is transit visa which means a visa allowing its holder to pass through a country only, not tostay there. The word ‘transit’ has also been defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary, 11th Edition, to mean the transportationof goods or person from one place to another; passage; the act of passing.\\n35.2. In Dr. Brojen Gogol, this Court did not decide whether the Bombay High Court had the jurisdiction to entertain theanticipatory bail applications of the respondents since the crimes were registered within the State of Assam. On the shortpoint that the State of Assam or the Assam police were not heard before granting anticipatory bail to the respondents, thisCourt set aside the order of the Bombay High Court but granted protection from arrest to the respondents for a limitedduration to enable them to approach the Gauhati High Court. While passing such an order, this Court however made ageneral observation that the question of granting anticipatory bail to any person who is allegedly connected with the offencein question, must for all practical purposes be considered by the High Court of Gauhati within whose \\x0c territorial jurisdictionsuch activities could have been perpetrated. As we have noted above, this was a general observation made by this Court andnot a declaration of law after due adjudication. 35.3. The Allahabad High Court in Anita Garg also noted that there is nolegislation or law which defines transit or anticipatory bail in definitive or specific terms. Thereafter, the High Courtproceeded to explain the term ‘transit’ to mean the act of being moved from one place to another. Since the expression‘anticipatory bail’ means granting bail to an accused person who is anticipating arrest, ‘transit anticipatory bail’ would refer tobail granted to any person who is apprehending arrest by police of a state other than the state he is presently located in. Onthat basis, Allahabad High Court explained ‘transit anticipatory bail’ to mean protection from arrest for a certain definiteperiod. The mere fact that an accused has been granted transit anticipatory bail does not mean that the regular court underwhose jurisdiction the case would fall, shall extend such transit bail and convert the same into anticipatory bail. Therefore,the Allahabad High Court held that upon the grant of transit anticipatory bail, the accused person who has been granted suchbail has to apply for regular anticipatory bail before the competent court which would then consider such a prayer on its ownmerits. Allahabad High Court has also held that transit anticipatory bail is a temporary relief which an accused gets for acertain period of time so that he can apply for anticipatory bail before the regular court. In this connection, \\x0c Allahabad HighCourt heavily relied upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in Teesta Atul Setalvad. In that case, Bombay High Courtheld that High Court of one State can grant transit bail in respect of a case registered within the jurisdiction of another HighCourt in exercise of the power under Section 438 of CrPC. Bombay High Court was of the view that generally the power ofa High Court to grant anticipatory bail is limited to its territorial jurisdiction and that the power cannot be usurped bydisregarding the principle of territorial jurisdiction. Having said that, the High Court emphasized that temporary relief toprotect liberty and to avoid immediate arrest can be given by the Bombay High Court.\\n36. In view of what we have discussed above, we are of the view that considering the constitutional imperative of protectinga citizen’s right to life, personal liberty and dignity, the High Court or the Court of Session could grant limited anticipatorybail in the form of an interim protection under Section 438 of CrPC in the interest of justice with respect to an FIR registeredoutside the territorial jurisdiction of the said Court, and subject to the following conditions:\\n(i) Prior to passing an order of limited anticipatory bail, the investigating officer and public prosecutor who are seizedof the FIR shall be issued notice on the first date of the hearing, though the Court in an appropriate case would havethe discretion to grant interim anticipatory bail.\\n\\x0c (ii) The order of grant of limited anticipatory bail must record reasons as to why the applicant apprehends an inter-state arrest and the impact of such grant of limited anticipatory bail or interim protection, as the case may be, on thestatus of the investigation.\\n(iii) The jurisdiction in which the cognizance of the offence has been taken does not exclude the said offence from thescope of anticipatory bail by way of a State Amendment to Section 438 of CrPC.\\n(iv) The applicant for anticipatory bail must satisfy the Court regarding his inability to seek anticipatory bail from theCourt which has the territorial jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence.

It would be impossible to fully account for all exigent circumstances in which an order of extra territorial anticipatory bailmay be imminently essential to safeguard the fundamental rights of the applicant. We reiterate that such power to grant extra-territorial anticipatory bail should be exercised in exceptional and compelling \\x0c circumstances only which means where,denying transit anticipatory bail or interim protection to enable the applicant to make an application under Section 438 ofCrPC before a Court of competent jurisdiction would cause irremediable and irreversible prejudice to the applicant. TheCourt, while considering such an application for extra-territorial anticipatory bail, in case it deems fit may grant interimprotection instead for a fixed period and direct the applicant to make an application before a Court of competent jurisdiction.\\n38. We therefore set aside the judgement of Patna High Court in Syed Zafrul Hassan and judgment of Calcutta High Courtin Sadhan Chandra Kolay to the extent that they hold that the High Court does not possess jurisdiction to grant extra-territorial anticipatory bail i.e., even a limited or transit anticipatory bail.\\n39. We shall now revert to our illustration given at the beginning of this judgment. In the illustration, we have stated that if aperson commits an offence in one State and the FIR is lodged within the jurisdiction where the offence was committed butthe accused resides in another State he can approach the Court in the other State and seek transit anticipatory bail of limitedduration. We have held that the accused could approach the competent Court in the State where he is residing or is visitingfor a legitimate purpose and seek the relief of limited transit anticipatory bail although the FIR is not filed in the \\x0c territorialjurisdiction of the District or State in which the accused resides, or is present depending upon the facts and circumstances ofeach case. Conversely, the offence may be committed in one State, the FIR may be lodged in another State and the accusedmay reside in a third State. In which of the Courts of the three States would the accused approach for grant of anticipatorybail? We feel that having regard to the salutary concept of access to justice, the accused can seek limited transit anticipatorybail or limited interim protection from the Court in the State in which he resides but in such an event, a ‘regular’ or full-fledged anticipatory bail could be sought from the competent Court in the State in which the FIR is filed.\\n40. We are conscious that this may also lead the accused to choose the Court of his choice for seeking anticipatory bail.Forum shopping may become the order of the day as the accused would choose the most convenient Court for seekinganticipatory bail. This would also make the concept of territorial jurisdiction which is of importance under the CrPC pale intoinsignificance. Therefore, in order to avoid the abuse of the process of the Court as well as the law by the accused, it isnecessary for the Court before which the plea for anticipatory bail is made, to ascertain the territorial connection or proximitybetween the accused and the territorial jurisdiction of the Court which is approached for seeking such a relief. Such a linkwith the territorial jurisdiction of the Court could be by way of place of residence or \\x0c occupation/work/profession. By this,we imply that the accused cannot travel to any other State only for the purpose of seeking anticipatory bail. The reason as towhy he is seeking such bail from a Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the FIR has not been filed must be made clearand explicit to such a Court. Also there must be a reason to believe or an imminent apprehension of arrest for a non-bailableoffence made out by the accused for approaching the Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the FIR is not lodged or theinability to approach the Court where the FIR is lodged immediately.\\n41. Having regard to the vastness of our country and the length and breadth of it and bearing in mind the complex nature oflife of the citizens, if an offence has been committed by a person in a particular State and if the FIR is filed in another Stateand the accused is a resident in a third State, bearing in mind access to justice, the accused who is residing in the third Stateor who is present there for a legitimate purpose should be enabled to seek the relief of limited anticipatory bail of transitorynature in the third State.\\n42. While we so hold, we are conscious of the fact that the expression High Court in Section 2(e) of the CrPC reads asfollows: (i) in relation to any State, the High Court for that State; (ii) in relation to a Union Territory to which the jurisdictionof the High Court for a State has been extended by law, that High Court; (iii) in relation to any other Union \\x0c Territory, thehighest Court of criminal appeal for that territory other than the Supreme Court of India. Section 6 of the CrPC states thatbesides the High Courts and the Courts constituted under any law, other than the CrPC, there shall be, in every State, interalia, Courts of Session. Section 7 speaks about territorial divisions. Sub-section (1) of Section 7 states that every State shallbe a sessions division or shall consist of sessions divisions; and every sessions division shall, for the purposes of CrPC, be adistrict or consist of districts. The proviso states that every metropolitan area shall be a separate session division and district.Sub-section (1) of Section 9 states that the State Government shall establish a Court of Session for every session division;every Court of Session shall be presided over by a Judge, to be appointed by the High Court; the High Court may alsoappoint Additional Sessions Judges to exercise jurisdiction in a Court of Session and such Judges may also sit in anotherdivision as may be directed by the High Court.\\n43. Section 26 of the CrPC deals with the Courts by which offences are triable which states that subject to the otherprovisions of the CrPC, any offence under the IPC may be tried by (i) the High Court; (ii) the Court of Session; or (iii) anyother Court by which such offence is shown in the First Schedule to be triable. In case of offences under any other lawwhen any Court is mentioned in this behalf in such law, being tried by such Court and when no Court is mentioned may betried by (i) the High \\x0c Court; or (ii) any other Court by which such offence is shown in the First Schedule to be triable.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='984406c1-00d1-41b7-a7c9-0516190a3d9d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '27', 'file_name': 'Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Personal\\\\code\\\\Lexify\\\\Lexify-task2\\\\docs\\\\Priya Indoria vs The State Of Karnataka on 20 November, 2023.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 737108, 'creation_date': '2025-03-20', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='44. Further, on a reading of Section 438 of CrPC, we do not find that the expression “the High Court” or “the Court ofSession” is restricted vis-à-vis the local limits or any particular territorial jurisdiction. However, this does not mean that if anFIR is lodged in one State then the accused can approach the Court in another State for seeking anticipatory bail. He can doso, if at the time of lodging of the FIR in any State, he is residing or is present there for a legitimate purpose in any otherState. In fact, on a reading of Section 438 of CrPC, it does not emerge that the expression “the High Court” or “the Court ofSession” must have reference only to the place or territorial jurisdiction within which the FIR is lodged. If that was theimplication, the same would have been expressly evident in the Section itself or by a necessary implication. Further use ofthe word “the” before the words “High Court” and “Court of Session” also does not mean that only the High Court or theCourt of Session, as the case may be, within whose jurisdiction the FIR is filed, is competent to exercise jurisdiction for thegrant of transit anticipatory bail.\\n45. At the same time, we are also mindful of the fact that the accused cannot seek full-fledged anticipatory bail in a Statewhere he is a resident when the FIR has been registered in a different State. However, \\x0c in view of what we have discussedabove, he would be entitled to seek a transit anticipatory bail from the Court of Session or High Court in the State where heis a resident which necessarily has to be of a limited duration so as to seek regular anticipatory bail from the Court ofcompetent jurisdiction. The need for such a provision is to secure the liberty of the individual concerned. Since anticipatorybail as well as transit anticipatory bail are intrinsically linked to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of Indiaand since we have extended the concept of access to justice to such a situation and bearing in mind Article 14 thereof itwould be necessary to give a constitutional imprimatur to the evolving provision of transit anticipatory bail. Otherwise, in adeserving case, there is likelihood of denial of personal liberty as well as access to justice for, by the time the personconcerned approaches the Court of competent jurisdiction to seek anticipatory bail, it may well be too late as he may bearrested. Needless to say, the Court granting transit anticipatory bail would obviously examine the degree and seriousness ofthe apprehension expressed by the person who seeks transit anticipatory bail; while the object underlying exercise of suchjurisdiction is to thwart arbitrary police action and to protect personal liberty besides providing immediate access to justicethough within a limited conspectus.\\n46. If a rejection of the plea for limited/transitory anticipatory bail is made solely with reference to the concept of territorialjurisdiction it \\x0c would be adding a restriction to the exercise of powers under Section\\n438. This, in our view, would result in miscarriage and travesty of justice, aggravating the adversity of the accused who isapprehending arrest. It would also be against the principles of access to justice. We say so for the reason that an accused ispresumed to be innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt and in accordance with law. In the circumstances, wehold that the Court of Session or the High Court, as the case may be, can exercise jurisdiction and entertain a plea for limitedanticipatory bail even if the FIR has not been filed within its territorial jurisdiction and depending upon the facts andcircumstances of the case, if the accused apprehending arrest makes out a case for grant of anticipatory bail but havingregard to the fact that the FIR has not been registered within the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court or Court of Session,as the case may, at the least consider the case of the accused for grant of transit anticipatory bail which is an interimprotection of limited duration till such accused approaches the competent Sessions Court or the High Court, as the case maybe, for seeking full-fledged anticipatory bail.\\n47. There can also be a case where the accused is facing multiple FIRs for the same offence in several States. He may seekan interim protection from a particular Sessions Court or the High Court in a State. Does he have to move from State toState for the purpose of seeking anticipatory bail or seek multiple pre-arrest bails? We would not attempt to give an \\x0c answerto such a situation as the facts of the present case do not involve such a situation.\\n48. Another issue that calls for reiteration is, whether, the ordinary place of inquiry and trial would include the place wherethe complainant-wife resides after being separated from her husband. The position of law regarding the ordinary place ofinvestigation and trial as per Section 177 of the CrPC, especially in matrimonial cases alleging cruelty and domestic violence,alleged by the wife, has advanced from the view held in the case of State of Bihar vs. Deokaran Nenshi, (1972) 2 SCC 890;Sujata Mukherjee (Smt.) vs. Prashant Kumar Mukherjee, (1997) 5 SCC 30; Y. Abraham Ajith vs. Inspector of Police,Chennai, (2004) 8 SCC 100, Ramesh vs. State of T.N. (2005) 3 SCC 507; Manish Ratan vs. State of M.P., (2007) 1 SCC262 that if none of the ingredients constituting the offence can be said to have occurred within the local jurisdiction, thatjurisdiction cannot be the ordinary place of investigation and trial of a matrimonial offence. A three judge Bench of this Courthas however clarified in Rupali Devi vs. State of U.P., (2019) 5 SCC 384 (Rupali Devi) that adverse effects on mental healthof the wife even while residing in her parental home on account of the acts committed in the matrimonial home wouldamount to commission of cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A at the parental home. It was held that the Courts at theplace where the wife takes shelter after leaving or being driven away from the matrimonial \\x0c home on account of acts ofcruelty committed by the husband or his relatives, would, depending on the factual situation, also have jurisdiction toentertain a complaint alleging commission of offences under Section 498-A of the IPC.\\n49.

Manufacturing defects tend to be the most\\nstraightforward of the three types of claims.\\nA manufacturing defect occurs because of a flaw in\\nconstruction or production. This type of defect occurs in\\nonly one or a few products of a particular type, rather than\\nan entire line. The product that causes injury is different\\nfrom the other ones. For example, a single motorcycle\\nmissing brake pads because the assembler of the motorcycle\\nleft them off would have a manufacturing defect. Similarly, a\\nsingle bottle of medicine that has been mixed improperly\\nsuch that is poisonous has a manufacturing defect. In order\\nto recover when there is a manufacturing defect, the\\nmanufacturing defect must be the actual and proximate\\ncause of an injury.\\nUnlike manufacturing defects, design defects are inherent to\\nan entire line of the same product.

Similarly, a toy that releases\\ntoxic fumes when used correctly would be defectively\\ndesigned. In order to recover for a design defect, the design\\nflaw rather than the plaintiff's negligent actions must have\\ncaused the plaintiff's injury.\\nMarketing defects concern inadequate instructions in how to\\nuse the product or a failure to warn of the product's latent\\ndangers. Typically, a failure to warn lawsuit revolves around\\na product that is dangerous in a non-obvious way or that\\nrequires a consumer to take certain safety measures when\\nusing it. For example, a medication that should not be mixed\\nwith another commonly used medication can be the subject\\nof a failure to warn lawsuit if a consumer mixes the two and\\nis injured.

A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. \\n80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \\nand without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful \\nmeans and with proper care and caution. \\nIllustration \\nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man wh o is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper \\ncaution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. \\n81. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge t hat it is likely to cause \\nharm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good f aith for the purpose of \\npreventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. \\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the ac t with the knowledge that \\nit was likely to cause harm. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any f ault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a \\nposition that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board , \\nunless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing  his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with \\nonly two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the \\nboat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, \\nthough he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matte r of \\nfact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conf lagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be f ound that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \\nimminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence. \\n82.

A is within the exception,   \\ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \\n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception .—A consent is not such a consent as \\nis intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \\nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to bel ieve, that the consent \\nwas given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \\nConsent of insane person .—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \\nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \\nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \\nwho is under twelve years of age. \\n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause .—The exceptions in \\nsections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which t hey \\nmay cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giv ing the consent, or \\non whose behalf the consent is given. \\nIllustration \\nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of sa ving the life of the woman) is an offence \\nindependently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman.

Here A, whether the act be committed or \\nnot, is guilty of abetting an offence. \\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under se ven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of th e unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong o r contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting  the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take p roperty belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A \\ninduces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's \\nproperty. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishon estly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of \\nabetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is \\nalso an offence. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and  C commits that offence in \\nconsequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his off ence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B \\nto commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspira cy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficien t if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\nIllustration \\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z.

A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \\nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the  poison to Z in A ’s absence and thereby causes Z ’s \\ndeath. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intentio n from that of \\nabettor.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a  \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for \\nthe offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge \\nof the abettor and with no other. \\n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done .—When an act is abetted \\nand a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent \\nas if he had directly abetted it: \\nProvided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the  \\ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the \\nabetment. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of \\nthe instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which  is by the side of that of Z. Here if the child was acting under \\nthe influence of A's instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable \\nin the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \\n(b) A instigates B to burn Z ’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of  property there. A, though \\nguilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of ab etting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probabl e \\nconsequence of the burning. \\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight fo r the purpose of robbery, and provides them with \\narms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder \\nwas the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder. \\n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done .—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is commit ted in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the d istress. As B has committed both the offence of \\nresisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, \\nif A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each \\nof the offences. \\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different fro m that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect cause d, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instig ation, causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in \\nconsequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the \\npunishment provided for murder. \\n114.

Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— \\n2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely \\nto cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— \\n3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury \\nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— \\n4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous t hat it must, in all \\nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and comm its such act without \\nany excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is like ly to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \\nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is g uilty of murder, although the blow might not have been \\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is \\nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in  the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of \\nhealth, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \\nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cau se the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. \\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although  \\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\nException 1 .—When culpable homicide is not murder .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, c auses the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\nFirst.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excus e for \\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public  \\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of \\nprivate defence. \\nExplanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from \\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and th e death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in  \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provoc ation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z.

A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does no t believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has \\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of p rivate defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing \\nso. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, an d kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was \\ngiving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a by stander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and \\nto cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only \\nculpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of t he \\nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to h im by law and causes the \\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without prem editation, and \\nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\nIllustration \\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievo us hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the \\nassault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other m eans prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has \\nnot committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding  a \\npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \\ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessar y for the due \\ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the perso n whose death is \\ncaused. \\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation i n a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having t aken undue \\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\nassault. \\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\nIllustration \\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years o f age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's \\nyouth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to ca use death, \\ncommits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows \\nhimself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of \\nwhich it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or k new \\nhimself to be likely to cause. \\n302.

A ha s therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so \\nwithout Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence , or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will \\ncause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to  quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has th erefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole a nd stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own b odily power moved his own person so as to bring \\nit into contact with Z.

Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z; and if he did so without Z's consent, inten ding thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal \\nforce to Z. \\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses fo rce to her, and if he does so without her consent \\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n(g) Z is bathing.

Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into con tact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \\nmust affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used forc e to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent \\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if  A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \\ncriminal force to Z. \\n351.

But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparat ions amount to an \\nassault. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to stri ke \\nZ.

Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation .—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by \\nthat person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term  which may extend to \\nthree months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. \\nExplanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under \\nthis section, if the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the of fender as an excuse for the \\noffence, or \\nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a p ublic servant, in the \\nlawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or \\nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \\n Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact. \\n353.

It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has \\nnot committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occup ies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A \\ndishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he \\nmay commit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not ven turing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is hig hly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the \\nintention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it w hen the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the \\nring, commits theft. \\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to h is shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters th e shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed crimi nal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \\nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the wa tch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes \\nthe watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z o f the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, \\ninasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's poss ession without Z's consent, not having paid what he \\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's co nsent, with the intention of keeping it until he \\nobtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence,  and takes away a book without Z's express \\nconsent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived \\nthat he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \\n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and cl othes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it \\nis probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give aw ay alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed \\ntheft. \\n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A  knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. \\nHere, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n379.

A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \\nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending \\nto cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decre e against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in co llusion with Z, executes a lease \\nof the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause \\nit to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure.
