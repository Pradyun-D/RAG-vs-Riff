JUSTICE NAJMI WAZIRI\\nO R D E R\\n% 08.01.2018\\nCM APPL. 461/2018 (Exemption)\\nAllowed subject to all just exceptions.\\nThe application stands disposed off.\\nFAO 7/2018 & CM APPL. 462/2018\\nThis appeal seeks setting aside of an order dated 24.11.2017 passed\\nby the learned Additional District Judge returning the plaint on the ground\\nthat the plaint is not maintainable for want of territorial jurisdiction. The\\nlearned counsel for the appellant submits that this was done at the pre-notice\\nstage, hence notice would not be necessary to the respondent for the decision\\nof the present appeal. In the circumstances, notice to the respondent is\\ndispensed with.\\nIt is the appellant’s case that a loan of Rs. 7,59,357/- had been\\nadvanced to the respondent for financing a vehicle bearing No. UP-16-AZ-\\n9109, namely, AWENTURA/ EMOTION. Since, there has been a default ofrepayment of the EMIs, the loan was recalled and the appellant sought\\npossession of the vehicle by way of appointment of a Receiver. The loan\\nrecall notice to the respondent did not evince any response.\\nThe reason for the returning of the plaint was that since the registered\\noffice of the bank is in Gujarat and the defendant is a resident of Noida,\\nhence the Court would have no jurisdiction. This reasoning is erroneous\\nbecause the loan documents were executed in Delhi, i.e., at Videocon\\nTower, Jhandewalan Extension, New Delhi and the loan was disbursed from\\nDelhi. The loan documents annexed to the appeal, show that first Credit\\nFacility Application Form and the irrevocable power of attorney, both were\\nexecuted by the respondent at Videocon Tower, Jhandewalan Extension,\\nNew Delhi. Cause of action arose in Delhi too. Accordingly, the suit would\\nbe maintainable in Delhi.\\nIn a similar case filed by the appellant bank, this Court held in ICICI\\nBank Ltd. vs. Astha Kumar & Anr. in FAO No. 214/2015 decided on\\n06.11.2015 and ICICI Bank Ltd. vs. Suresh & Anr. in FAO 51/2017\\ndecided on 28.02.2017, that the Delhi Courts would have jurisdiction to\\nadjudicate the lis. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that in view\\nof the above, the Trial Court would be bound to go by the averments as\\nmade in the plaint. The veracity of the averments in the suit would, however,\\nbe decided after the leading of evidence.\\nIn view of the aforesaid, the Court finds that there were sufficient\\ngrounds for the Trial Court to issue notice to adjudicate the matter.\\nAccordingly, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order dated\\n24.11.2017 is set aside. The Trial Court is directed to recommence the\\nproceedings and issue notice to the respondent.At the request of the learned counsel for the appellant in view of the\\ndecision in ICICI Bank Ltd. vs. Astha Kumar & Anr. in FAO No. 214/2015\\ndelivered on 06.11.2015, so as to prevent any prejudice that may be caused\\nto the appellant apropos the hypothecated vehicle in question, the appellant’s\\nrepresentative Mr. Sudhir Vashisht is appointed as a Receiver to take\\npossession of vehicle bearing no. UP-16-AZ-9109, namely, AWENTURA/\\nEMOTION. He shall take possession of the same in terms of the directions\\npassed by this Court in FAO 51/2017 titled as ICICI Bank Ltd. vs. Suresh\\n& Anr. decided on 28.02.2017. The relevant directions are reproduced\\nhereunder:-\\n“12. The receiver shall take over the possession of the\\nvehicle from the respondent at the address(es) given in the\\nloan application. If the vehicle is not available at the said\\naddress(es), the receiver shall be at liberty to recover the\\nvehicle wherever found. However, the receiver shall not stop a\\nrunning vehicle on the road to forcibly take out the driver to\\ntake the possession of the vehicle. The receiver shall also not\\nmake any attempt to block the passage of a car to bring it to a\\nhalt to take its possession.\\n13. The receiver shall avoid taking the possession of the\\nvehicle if the vehicle is occupied by a woman who is not\\naccompanied by a male member or an elderly, infirm or\\nphysically/mentally challenged person. In such cases, the\\nreceiver shall take the possession of the vehicle from the\\nborrower’s residence.\\n14. The receiver shall be at liberty to take the assistance\\nof the local police, if required, for taking over possession of\\nthe vehicle. The concerned SHO shall provide assistance to the\\nreceiver as and when requested.\\n15. The receiver shall also ensure that the repossession\\nof the vehicle does not result in any breach of peace. In the\\nevent of any breach of peace by the person occupying the\\nvehicle, the receiver shall not proceed without assistance ofpolice.\\n16. At the time of taking the custody of the vehicle, the\\nreceiver shall deliver copy of this order to the person from\\nwhom the possession is taken.\\n17. At the time of taking the custody of the vehicle, the\\nreceiver shall take the photographs of the vehicle from\\ndifferent angles along with the person(s) occupying the vehicle\\nas well as the place of taking over the possession.\\n18. The receiver shall prepare an inventory of the\\narticles/accessories found in the vehicle and shall furnish the\\ncopy of the inventory to the person from whom the possession\\nis taken.\\n19. After taking the possession of the vehicle, the\\nreceiver shall keep the vehicle in safe custody.\\n20. If the respondent makes payment of the outstanding\\ninstalments as on date of possession, the receiver shall release\\nthe vehicle in question to the respondent on superdari, subject\\nto an undertaking by the respondent to the receiver for regular\\nrepayment of future monthly instalments till the expiry of the\\ntenure and a declaration not to part with the vehicle or create\\nthird party interest in the vehicle until the entire amount is\\npaid.\\n21. If the respondent is not in a position to clear the\\nentire outstanding instalments, the receiver shall give him\\nanother opportunity to pay the outstanding instalments within\\n30 days of taking over the possession of the vehicle and in case\\nthe respondent makes the payment of the outstanding\\ninstalments within the said period, the receiver shall release\\nthe vehicle to the respondent subject to the undertaking as\\naforementioned.\\n22. If the respondent does not make the payment of the\\noutstanding amount to the appellant bank within 60 days, the\\nreceiver would be authorised to sell the vehicle in question in\\na public auction with prior written notice (to be sent by Speed\\nPost AD) of the date of auction to the respondent at the\\naddress(es) mentioned in the loan agreement or the address\\nfrom where the vehicle is taken into possession so that the\\nrespondent may also be able to participate in the auction toenable the appellant to fetch maximum amount from the sale of\\nthe vehicle. The receiver shall carry out video recording of the\\nauction proceedings and shall submit the same before the Trial\\nCourt along with his final report.\\n23. That the receiver shall submit his first report before\\nthe Trial Court within 10 days of taking the custody of the\\nvehicle along with the photographs and inventory mentioned\\nabove. The final report shall be submitted before the Trial\\nCourt within 10 days of the public auction along with the\\nproceedings for public auction and video recording of the\\npublic auction.....”\\nThe Trial Court record be returned back forthwith and the matter be\\nlisted before the Trial Court on 6th February, 2018.\\nThe appeal and the pending application stand disposed off.\\nCopy of this order be given dasti to the learned counsel for the\\nappellant under the signatures of the Court Master.\\nNAJMI WAZIRI, J\\nJANUARY 08, 2018\\nRW\",\n",

Petitioner \\nvs. \\nUnion of India & Anr .. Respondents \\nCWP-5361-2016 \\n \\nGurmail Singh ... Petitioner \\nvs. \\nUnion of India & Anr .. Respondents \\nCORAM:    HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ARUN MONGA \\nPresent : Mr. Sushil Jain, Advocate \\nfor the petitioner in CWP-1554-2016. \\nMr. B.D.Sharma, Advocate \\nfor the petitioner in CWP-5361-2016. \\nMr. Arun Gosain, Advocate \\nfor the respondent-UOI in CWP-1554-2016. \\nMr. Parveen Chander Goyal, Advocate \\nfor respondents in CWP-5361-2016. \\n***** \\nARUN MONGA, J.(ORAL) \\n Vide this order, the above mentioned two writ petitions are \\nbeing disposed of as common issues are involved therein. \\n2. Concededly, the petitioners were dismissed from service due to \\nregistration of an FIR No. 193 dated 03.09.2013 which led to issuance of \\ncharge-sheet wherein similar charges were framed against the petitioners as \\nin the criminal case. \\n3. Departmental proceedings were carried out and based on the \\nstatements of the witnesses, who were common in the criminal case being \\ntried simultaneously, the petitioners were indicted. CWP-1554-2016 (O&M) & CWP-5361-2016 -2-\\n4. Inquiry  report  was  accepted  by  the  Disciplinary  Authority \\nwhich led to the passing of punishment order of dismissal, impugned herein. \\n5. However,  criminal  proceedings  resulted  in  acquittal  of  the \\npetitioners and acquittal order has since attained finality as no appeal was \\nfiled against the same. \\n6. Learned  counsels  for  the  petitioners  contend  that once  it  is \\nestablished  that  the  petitioners  were  acquitted  by  a  competent  court  of \\ncriminal  jurisdiction,  there  is  no  plausible  reason available  with  the \\nrespondents for not giving the benefit of the said acquittal by revoking their \\nsuspension and reinstating them in service. \\n7. After having heard rival contentions of learned counsels and \\nhaving  gone  through  the  pleadings  alongwith  relevant  record,  I  am \\nconvinced that the case of the petitioner is squarely covered by Rule 27 \\n(CCC) of  Central Reserve Police Force. For ready reference, the same is \\nreproduced hereinbelow:- \\n“When  a  member  of  the  Force  has  been  tried  and \\nacquitted by a criminal Court, he shall not be punished \\ndepartmentally under this rule on the same charge or on \\na similar charge upon the evidence cited in the criminal \\ncase, whether actually led or not except with the prior \\nsanction  of  the  Inspector  General.  (Inserted  vide  SO \\n3117 dated 15.7.71)” \\nA perusal of the  above leaves no manner of doubt that the \\npetitioners are entitled to be reinstated. \\n8. Even otherwise, every acquittal is honourable acquittal. There \\nis nothing in the Criminal Procedure Code nor is there any rule of criminal \\njurisprudence for treating the effects and consequences of an acquittal on \\nfailure to prove charges from an acquittal on failure of the prosecution to CWP-1554-2016 (O&M) & CWP-5361-2016 -3-\\nprove the case beyond reasonable doubt. \\n9. A  Division  Bench  of  this  Court  in  a  case  titled  as  Shashi \\nKumar Vs. Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam and another, 2005 (1) SCT \\n576  relying in turn on another Division Bench of Madras High Court has \\nheld that the terms honourable acquittal or fully exonerated are unknown in \\nthe Criminal Jurisprudence. His Lordship S.S.Nijjar, J. (as he then was of \\nthis Court) speaking for the Division Bench observed as below:- \\n7. In  any  event,  the  terms  “honourable  acquittal”  or \\n“fully exonerated” are unknown in the Code of Criminal \\nProcedure  or  in  Criminal  Jurisprudence. These  terms\\ncame up for consideration before a Division Bench of the \\nMadras High Court in the case of Union of India Vs.\\nJayaram,  AIR  1960  Madras  325.  Rajammannar,  C.J. \\nDelivering the judgment of the Division Bench observed \\nas under:- \\nThere  is  no  conception  like  “honourable \\nacquittal” in Criminal Procedure Code The \\nonus of establishing the guilt of accused is \\non the prosecution, and if it fails to establish \\nthe  guilt  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the \\naccused is entitled to be acquitted. \\nClause (b) of Article 193 of the Civil Service \\nRegulations  which  says  that  when  a \\nGovernment  servant  who  was  under \\nsuspension is honourably acquitted, he may \\nbe given the full salary to which he would \\nhave  been  entitled  if  he  had  not  been \\nsuspended  applies  only  to  the  case  of \\ndepartmental Inquiry. \\nWhere the servant was suspended because \\nthere  was  a  criminal  prosecution  against \\nhim,  and  he  was  acquitted  therein,  and \\nreinstated he is entitled under the general \\nlaw, to the full pay during the period of his \\nsuspension. To such a case Article 193(b) \\ndoes not apply.” \\n8. The aforesaid judgment of the Madras High Court \\nwas considered and followed by this Court in the case of \\nJagmohan  Lal  Vs.  State  of  Punjab  through  Secy.  To \\nPunjab  Govt.  Irrigation  and  others,  AIR  1967  (54) \\nPunjab  and  Haryana  422  (punjab).  In  that  case,  on \\nacquittal, the petitioner was reinstated in service, but his \\nperiod of suspension was not treated as the period spent \\non  duty.  He  had,  therefore,  filed  writ  petition  under CWP-1554-2016 (O&M) & CWP-5361-2016 -4-\\nArticles 226/227 of the Constitution of India claiming \\nthat he was entitled to full pay and allowances for the \\nperiod  of  his  suspension.  Considering  the  impact  of\\nRules 7.3,7.5 and 7.6 of the Punjab Civil Services Rules \\nVol.I Part-I, it was observed as follows:- \\n(2) XXX XXX XXX \\nThe interpretation which has been put \\nby the Government on the rule is incorrect. \\nThe blame which attached to the petitioner \\nwas that there was a criminal charge against \\nhim under which he was standing his trial. \\nThe moment he is acquitted of the charge, he \\nis acquitted of the blame. In criminal law, \\nthe Courts are called upon to decide whether \\nthe  prosecution  has  succeeded  in  bringing \\nhome the guilt to the accused. The moment \\nthe Court is not satisfied regarding the guilt \\nof the accused, he is acquitted. Whether a \\nperson  is  acquitted  after  being  given  a \\nbenefit  of  doubt  or  for  that  reasons,  the \\nresult  is  that  his  guilt  is  not  proved.  The \\nCode  of  Criminal  Procedure  does  not \\ncontemplate honourable acquittal. The \\nonly  words  known  to  the  Code  are \\n'discharged'  or  'acquitted'.  The  effect  of  a \\nperson being discharged or acquitted is the \\nsame in the eyes of law. Since, according to \\nthe accepted notions of imparting criminal \\njustice,  the  Court  has  to  be  satisfied \\nregarding the guilt of the accused beyond a \\nreasonable  doubt,  it  is  generally  held  that \\nthere being a doubt in the mind of the court, \\nthe accused is acquitted. \\nI am, therefore, quite clear in my mind \\nthat the intention underlying Rule 7.5 can be \\nno  other  except  this”  the  moment  the \\ncriminal  charge  on  account  of  which  an \\nofficer was suspended fails in a court of law, \\nhe should be deemed to be acquitted of the \\nblame.  Any  other  interpretation  would \\ndefeat  the  very  purpose  of  the  rule.  It  is \\nfutile  to  expect  a  finding  of  either \\nhonourable acquittal or complete innocence \\nin  a  judgment  of  acquittal. The reason  is \\nobvious;  the  criminal  courts  are  not \\nconcerned  to  find  the  innocence  of  the \\naccused. They  are  only  concerned  to  find \\nwhether  the  prosecution  has  succeeded  in \\nproving beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt \\nof the accused.” CWP-1554-2016 (O&M) & CWP-5361-2016 -5-\\n10. In the premise, writ petition is allowed. Impugned orders are set \\naside with all consequential benefits to the petitioners. \\n11. Miscellaneous application, if any, also stands disposed of. \\n12. Photocopy of this order be placed on the connected file. \\n16.10.2019  (ARUN MONGA) \\nsmriti                   JUDGE \\nWhether speaking/reasoned : Yes/No \\nWhether Reportable : Yes/No \"]"

      "*   **Territorial Jurisdiction:** The lender needs to argue that the Delhi court *does* have territorial jurisdiction. Here's how:\n",
      "    *   **Cause of Action:** Argue that a portion of the cause of action arose in Delhi. For example, if the loan agreement was executed in Delhi, payments were to be made in Delhi, or the borrower resides/works in Delhi.\n",
      "    *   **Borrower's Residence/Business:** Establish that the borrower \"actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain\" within the local limits of the Delhi court's jurisdiction (Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)).\n",
      "    *   **Leave of the Court:** If there are multiple defendants and one resides within the jurisdiction of the Delhi court, the lender could argue that with the leave of the court, the suit can proceed against the borrower as well (Section 20 CPC).\n",
      "    *   **Contractual Jurisdiction:** If the loan agreement contains a clause specifying the jurisdiction of a particular court (which may or may not include Delhi), this clause will be very important. However, such clauses are generally interpreted strictly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Options to Challenge the Order:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Appeal:** The lender can file an appeal against the order of the Delhi court. The appeal would typically lie to a higher court within the Delhi judicial system (e.g., the High Court of Delhi).\n",
      "*   **Revision Petition:** In some cases, a revision petition may be an available remedy. This is generally used when there is an error of jurisdiction or a procedural irregularity. The availability of a revision petition depends on the specific provisions of the CPC and the rules of the Delhi High Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Search for Supporting Legal Precedents:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Use the `find_similar_arguments` tool to find cases with similar facts regarding loan recovery suits and territorial jurisdiction. This can provide persuasive arguments and highlight how other courts have dealt with comparable situations.\n",
      "*   Use the `search_documents` tool to research relevant sections of the Code of Civil Procedure (especially Section 20) and any applicable case law regarding territorial jurisdiction in loan recovery matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Alternative Action:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **File in Mumbai:** If the lender is unable to establish jurisdiction in Delhi, the lender will have to file the suit in a court in Mumbai that has territorial jurisdiction over the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the lender's primary focus should be on demonstrating that the Delhi court *does* have territorial jurisdiction based on the cause of action, the borrower's residence/business, or a contractual jurisdiction clause. They should then pursue an appeal or revision petition, supported by relevant legal precedents and statutory provisions.**\n",
